# SPPARKS App "grain"

# app_style	grain lat Nx Ny (Nz) Ns 12345 = lattice of type lat and size Nx by Ny (by Nz), Ns = spins, RN
#		lat = square_8nn, square_4nn, cubic_26nn, cubic_6nn
# sweep_style   grain 12345 (mask yes/no) (strict yes/no) (delt dt = time per sweep, default 1.0)
# solve_style   see documentation for solve styles (serial execution only)
# temperature	300.0 = temp (degrees K), currently only T=0 algorithms implemented
# stats		dt = print stats every dt time units
# dump		dt file = print snapshot to file every dt time units
# run	 	t = run for t time units

# Grain growth on a 2D Lattice using masking, and strict
# This is slower than non-strict, but will give the same
# answer on any number of processors, with or without mask.
