diag_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style style delta keyword value keyword value ... :pre

style = {cluster} or {cluster2d} or {cluster3d} or {eprof3d} or {energy} or {energy2d} or {energy3d} :ulb,l
delta = time increment between evaluations of the diagnostic (seconds) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {log} :l
  {log} values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval :pre
see doc pages for individual diagnostic commands for additional keywords that can be appended :l,ule

[Examples:]

diag_style cluster 1.0 
diag_style eprof3d 10.0
diag_style energy2d 0.01 log 7 10.0 :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes a diagnostic calculation every {delta} seconds
during a simulation.  Currently, diagnostics can only be defined for
on-lattice applications.  See the "app_style"_app_style.html command
for an overview of such applications.

As described by the "app_style"_app_style.html command, on-lattice
applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d, or 3d.  For
several of the diagnostic styles, you must use a style that matches
the application's lattice.

The diagnostics currently available are:

"cluster"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for general lattices
"cluster2d"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for 2d lattices
"cluster3d"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for 3d lattices
"eprof3d"_diag_eprof.html = site energy as function of distance from sector boundary for 3d lattices
"energy"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for general lattices
"energy2d"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for 2d lattices
"energy3d"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for 3d lattiecs :ul

How to output the info - via stats? to a file?

Using the {log} keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be {N}
outputs per interval where the size of each interval scales up by
{factor} each time.  {Delta} is the time between outputs in the first
(smallest) interval.

For example, this command

diag_style energy 0.01 log 7 10.0 :pre

will perform its computation at these times:

t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.07, 1.0, 2.0, ...., 7.0, 10.0, 20.0, .... :pre

This command

diag_style energy 0.01 log 1 2.0 :pre

will perform its computation at these times:

t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, ... :pre
