diag_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style style keyword value keyword value ... :pre

style = {cluster} or {cluster2d} or {cluster3d} or {eprof3d} or {energy} or {energy2d} or {energy3d} :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {delt} or {log} or {stats}
  {delt} values = delta
    delta = time increment between evaluations of the diagnostic (seconds)
  {log} values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval
  {stats} values = {yes} or {no}
    yes/no = provide output to stats line :pre
see doc pages for individual diagnostic commands for additional keywords that can be appended after these keywords :l,ule

[Examples:]

diag_style cluster stats no delt 1.0 
diag_style eprof3d stats no delt 0.01 log 7 10.0
diag_style energy2d :pre

[Description:]

This command invokes a diagnostic calculation.  Currently, diagnostics
can only be defined for on-lattice applications.  See the
"app_style"_app_style.html command for an overview of such
applications.  As described by the "app_style"_app_style.html command,
on-lattice applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d,
or 3d.  For several of the diagnostic styles, you must use a style
that matches the application's lattice.

The diagnostics currently available are:

"cluster"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for general lattices
"cluster2d"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for 2d lattices
"cluster3d"_diag_cluster.html = grain size statistics for 3d lattices
"eprof3d"_diag_eprof.html = site energy as function of distance from sector boundary for 3d lattices
"energy"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for general lattices
"energy2d"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for 2d lattices
"energy3d"_diag_energy.html = compute energy of entire system for 3d lattiecs :ul

:line

Diagnostics may provide one or more values that are appended to other
statistical output and printed to the screen and log file via the
"stats"_stats.html command.  We call this stats output. In addition,
the diagnostic may optionally write more extensive output to files if
requested by diagnostic-specific keywords.

The {stats} keyword controls whether or not the diagnostic appends
values to the statistical output. If stats is set to yes, then the
{delt} and {log} keywords may not be used, as the output interval is
controlled by the {stats} command.  If stats is set to no, then the
{delt} keyword specificies {Delta}, the interval of time between each
diagnostic calculation.  Using the {log} keyword will cause the
diagnostic to run at varying intervals during the course of a
simulation.  There will be {N} outputs per interval where the size of
each interval scales up by {factor} each time.  {Delta} is the time
between outputs in the first (smallest) interval.

For example, this command

diag_style eprof3d stats no delt 0.01 log 7 10.0 :pre

will perform its computation at these times:

t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.07, 1.0, 2.0, ...., 7.0, 10.0, 20.0, .... :pre

This command

diag_style enegy eprof3d stats no delt 0.01 log 1 2.0 :pre

will perform its computation at these times:

t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, ... :pre
