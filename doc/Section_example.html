<H3>5. Example problems 
</H3>
<P>The SPPARKS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with
several sample problems.  Each problem is in a sub-directory of its
own.  Most are small models that can be run quickly, requiring at most
a couple of minutes to run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an
input script (in.*) and produces a log file (log.*) and dump file
(dump.*) when it runs.  A few sample log file outputs on different
machines and different numbers of processors are included in the
directories to compare your answers to.  E.g. a log file like
log.potts.foo.P means it ran on P processors of machine "foo".
</P>
<P>In some cases, the dump files produced by the example runs can be
animated using the various visuzlization tools, such as the Pizza.py
toolkit referenced in the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">Additional Tools</A>
section of the SPPARKS documentation.  Animations of some of these
examples can be viewed on the Movies section of the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/spparks.html">SPPARKS WWW
Site</A>.
</P>
<P>These are the sample problems in the examples sub-directories:

<DIV ALIGN=center><TABLE  BORDER=1 >
<TR><TD >groups</TD><TD > test of group-based KMC solver</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >ising</TD><TD > standard Ising model</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >membrane</TD><TD > membrane model of pore formation around protein inclusions</TD></TR>
<TR><TD >potts</TD><TD > multi-state Potts model for grain growth 
</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV>

<P>Here is how you might run and visualize one of the sample problems:
</P>
<PRE>cd examples/potts
cp ../../src/spk_linux .           # copy SPPARKS executable to this dir
spk_linux < in.potts               # run the problem 
</PRE>
<P>Running the simulation produces the files <I>dump.potts</I> and
<I>log.spparks</I>.
