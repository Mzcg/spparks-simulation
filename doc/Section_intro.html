<P>These sections provide an overview of what KMC can and can't do,
describe what it means for KMC to be an open-source code, and
acknowledge the funding and people who have contributed to KMC over
the years.

<A NAME = "1_1"></A><H4>1.1 What is KMC 
</H4>
<P>KMC is a kinetic Monte Carlo code.
</P>
<P>KMC runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop
machines, but is designed for parallel computers.  It will run on any
parallel machine that compiles C++ and supports the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</A>
message-passing library.  This includes distributed- or shared-memory
parallel machines and Beowulf-style clusters.
</P>


<P>KMC is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</A>, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See <A HREF = "#1_4">this section</A> for a brief
discussion of the open-source philosophy.
</P>


<P>KMC is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new
capabilities, such as new force fields, atom types, boundary
conditions, or diagnostics.  See <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> for
more details.
</P>
<P>KMC is written in C++.
</P>


<P>In the most general sense, KMC integrates Newton's equations of motion
for collections of atoms, molecules, or macroscopic particles that
interact via short- or long-range forces with a variety of initial
and/or boundary conditions.  For computational efficiency KMC uses
neighbor lists to keep track of nearby particles.  The lists are
optimized for systems with particles that are repulsive at short
distances, so that the local density of particles never becomes too
large.  On parallel machines, KMC uses spatial-decomposition
techniques to partition the simulation domain into small 3d
sub-domains, one of which is assigned to each processor.  Processors
communicate and store "ghost" atom information for atoms that border
their sub-domain.  KMC is most efficient (in a parallel sense) for
systems whose particles fill a 3d rectangular box with roughly uniform
density.  Papers with technical details of the algorithms used in KMC
are listed in <A HREF = "#1_5">this section</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "1_2"></A><H4>1.2 KMC features 
</H4>
<P>This section highlights KMC features, with pointers to specific
commands which give more details.  If KMC doesn't have your
favorite interatomic potential, boundary condition, or atom type, see
<A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A>, which describes how you can add it to
KMC.
</P>

</H4>
<P>Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for KMC simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.

<A NAME = "1_3"></A><H4>1.3 KMC non-features 
</H4>
<P>KMC is designed to efficiently compute Newton's equations of motion
for a system of interacting particles.  Many of the tools needed to
pre- and post-process the data for such simulations are not included
in the KMC kernel for several reasons:
</P>
<UL><LI>the desire to keep KMC simple
<LI>they are not parallel operations
<LI>other codes already do them
<LI>limited development resources 
</UL>
<P>Specifically, KMC itself does not:
</P>
<UL><LI>run thru a GUI
<LI>build molecular systems
<LI>assign force-field coefficients automagically
<LI>perform sophisticated analyses of your MD simulation
<LI>visualize your MD simulation
<LI>plot your output data 
</UL>
<P>A few tools for pre- and post-processing tasks are provided as part of
the KMC package; they are described in <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this
section</A>.  However, many people use other codes or
write their own tools for these tasks.
</P>
<P>As noted above, our group has also written and released a separate
toolkit called <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which addresses some of the listed
bullets.  It provides tools for doing setup, analysis, plotting, and
visualization for KMC simulations.  Pizza.py is written in
<A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the Pizza.py WWW
site</A>.
</P>
<P>KMC requires as input a list of initial atom coordinates and types,
molecular topology information, and force-field coefficients assigned
to all atoms and bonds.  KMC will not build molecular systems and
assign force-field parameters for you.
</P>
<P>Similarly, KMC creates output files in a simple format.  Most users
post-process these files with their own analysis tools or re-format
them for input into other programs, including visualization packages.
If you are convinced you need to compute something on-the-fly as
KMC runs, see <A HREF = "Section_modify.html">this section</A> for a discussion of how you
can use the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> and <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> commands to print out
data of your choosing.  Keep in mind that complicated computations can
slow down the molecular dynamics timestepping, particularly if the
computations are not parallel, so it is often better to leave such
analysis to post-processing codes.
</P>
<P>A very simple (yet fast) visualizer is provided with the KMC
package - see the <A HREF = "Section_tools.html#xmovie">xmovie</A> tool in <A HREF = "Section_tools.html">this
section</A>.  It creates xyz projection views of
atomic coordinates and animates them.  We find it very useful for
debugging purposes.  For high-quality visualization we recommend the
following packages:

<P>Other features that KMC does not yet (and may never) support are
discussed in <A HREF = "Section_history.html">this section</A>.

<P>Here is a summary of what the GPL means for KMC users:
</P>
<P>(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend KMC in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>(2) If you distribute a modified version of KMC, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
KMC.
</P>
<P>(3) If you release any code that includes KMC source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms
of the GPL.
</P>
<P>(4) If you give KMC files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.
</P>
<P>In the spirit of an open-source code, these are various ways you can
contribute to making KMC better.  You can send email to the
