<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>inclusion fraction 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>fraction = fraction of sites (0 to 1) to convert to pinned sites 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>pin 0.1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command converts sites on a lattice to pinned sites by setting
their spin value to Q+1, where Q is defined by a Potts model.  This
command can only be used by the <A HREF = "app_potts_pin.html">app_style
potts/pin</A> application.
</P>
<P>Pinned sites are chosen randomly until the desired fraction of
changed sites is achieved.  The selection is done in a way
that should be independent of the number of processors used to
run a particular simulation.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B> none
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of the <A HREF = "app_potts_pin.html">app_style
potts/pin</A> applications.
