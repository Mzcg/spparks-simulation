app_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style args :pre

style = application style name
args = args :ul

[Examples:]

app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 :pre

[Description:]

solve_style linear seed
solve_style tree seed
solve_style alias seed
solve_style group lo hi seed
solve_style group lo hi ngroups seed
solve_style gppt seed

seed = RN seed
lo,hi = range of propensities
ngroups = 0 (or not listed), use logarithmic scaling
ngroups > 1, use this number of groups

update of sites owned by a processor via a KMC algorithm
  which chooses events and associated timesteps randomly
used when running a non lattice app (chemistry, surf, test)
  can only run on 1 processor
if used with a lattice app (ising, potts, membrane, migration)
  and no sweep style is set
    can only run on 1 processor
    entire domain is treated via KMC
if used with a lattice app and a sweep style is set
  if running on 1 processor, domain is partitioned into sectors
    KMC is run on each and periodic boundaries are updated after each event
  if running in parallel, each proc's sub-domain is partitioned into sectors
    KMC is run on each and boundaries are updated between sectors
    this is an approximate parallel KMC algorithm

style linear chooses the next event in linear, cost = O(N)
  update of propensities is O(1)
style tree chooses the next event from a binary tree, cost = O(NlogN)
  update of propensities is also O(NlogN)
style alias does what?
style group does what?
style gppt does what?
