app_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style args :pre

style = application style name
args = args :ul

[Examples:]

app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 :pre

[Description:]

sweep_style lattice2d seed option arg option arg ...
sweep_style lattice3d seed option arg option arg ...

options and args:
  strict yes/no = enforce ??
  mask yes/no = use a mask on each site to skip if possible
  picklocal yes/no = pick new spin from neighbors or all possible
  kmc yes/no = run KMC on sub-domain or sweep in ordered fashion
  delt 1.0 = time associated with one sweep (seconds)

defaults:
  strict no, mask no, picklocal no, kmc no, delt = 1.0

perform a Metroplis or KMC update of sites owned by a processor
  by sweeping over lattice sites in a regular fashion
must use lattice2d or lattice3d that correspods to the app_style (2d or 3d)
  do we check for this ??
used when running a lattice-based app (ising, potts, membrane, migration)

if define just a sweep style:
  domain will be broken into 4 or 8 sectors for 2d or 3d
  each will be iterated on in turn
  communication of boundary info will be done between sectors
if define just a solve style:
  no sweeping is done
  entire domain is treated as one set of KMC propensities
if define both a sweep and solve style:
  same partitioning into 4 or 8 sectors is done
  each sector is treated as one set of KMC propensities
  KMC updates are done until delt is reached
  then boundary is updated via communication
  this is an approximate parallel KMC algorithm
if use sweep style when running on 1 proc, entire domain is partitioned
  into 4 or 8 sectors

what does each option mean ??
which options can be used in combination and what do they mean ??
if KMC option is used, options strict, picklocal, mask are ignored
for KMC option, it's important to choose delt correctly
  how to choose correctly ??
  what happens if too small
  what happens if too large
