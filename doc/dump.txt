dump command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump delta style filename :pre

delta = time increment between dumps (seconds)
style = {lattice} or {coord}
filename = name of file to dump snapshots to :ul

[Examples:]

dump 0.25 lattice tmp.dump
dump 5.0 coord snap.ising :pre

[Description:]

Dump snapshots of the state of the system to a file every so many
seconds during a simulation.  The quantities printed are obtained from
the application.  Typically these are the values of the various sites
in the simulation.

Three styles of dump file are supported, though not every application
supports both.  The {lattice} style simply outputs a list of site IDs
and values (e.g. spin).  The {coord} style outputs a LAMMPS-compatible
dump file where each site has a type (e.g. spin value) and an x,y,z
coordinate.  The {coord} style output can be visualized with various 
tools in the "LAMMPS package"_lammps and the "Pizza.py package"_pizza.
The {opendx} style generates a sequentially-numbered set of files that
can be visualized using the OpenDX package.
