<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines what model or application SPPARKS will run.
There are 3 kinds of applications: general, on-lattice, and
off-lattice.
</P>
<P>General applications typically involve no spatial information.  Here
is the list of general applications SPPARKS currently includes.  See
the doc page for each application for details:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "app_chemistry.html">chemistry</A> = biochemical reaction networks
<LI><A HREF = "app_test_group.html">test/group</A> = artificial chemical networks that test <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> 
</UL>
<P>On-lattice applications define a lattice of points in space on which
events occur.  Here is the list of on-lattice applications SPPARKS
currently includes:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">diffusion</A> = vacancy exchange diffusion model
<LI><A HREF = "app_ising.html">ising</A> = Ising model
<LI><A HREF = "app_ising.html">ising/single</A> = variant Ising model
<LI><A HREF = "app_membrane.html">membrane</A> = membrane model of lipid,water,protein
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts</A> = Potts model for grain growth
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts/neigh</A> = variant Potts model
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts/neighonly</A> = variant Potts model
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts_pin.html">potts/pin</A> = Potts model with pinning sites
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts/variable</A> = variant Potts model 
</UL>
<P>Off-lattice applications define points in space at which events occur,
but the points are not on a regular lattice.  Here is the list of
off-lattice applications SPPARKS currently includes.
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "app_relax.html">relax</A> = Metropolis Monte Carlo relaxation 
</UL>
<P>The general applications in SPPARKS can only be evolved via a kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) solver, specified by the
<A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> command.  On-lattice and off-lattice
applications can be evolved by either a KMC solver or a rejection
kinetic Monte Carlo (rKMC) method or a Metropolis method.  The rKMC
and Metropolis methods are specified by the <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A>
command.  Not all on- and off-lattice applications support each
option.
</P>
<P>The KMC algorithm is sometimes called rejection-free KMC or the N-fold
way or the Gillespie algorithm in the MC literature.  The application
defines a list of "events" and associated rates for each event.  The
solver chooses the next event, and the application updates the system
accordingly.  This includes updating of the time, which is done
accurately since rates are defined for each event.  For general
applications the definition of an "event" is arbitrary.  For
on-lattice application zero or more possible events are typically
defined for each lattice site.
</P>
<P>The rKMC algorithm is sometimes called null-event KMC or null-event
MC.  Successive lattice sites are chosen via some method (see the
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command), and an event on that site is selected
which is accepted or rejected.  Again, the application defines the
"events" for each site and associated rates which influence the
acceptance or rejection.  It also defines the null event which is
essentially part of the rejection probability.  The updating is
time-accurate as with the KMC algorithm, since rates are defined for
each event, including the null event.
</P>
<P>The Metropolis algorithm is similar to the rKMC method, except that it
is not time-accurate.  It selects an event to perform and accepts or
rejects it, typically based on an energy change in the system.  There
is no rate associated with the event, and no requirement that events
be chosen with relative probabilities corresponding to their rates.
The effect of the Metropolis algorithm is to evolve the system towards
a low energy state.  As with the rKMC algorithm, the
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command is used to determine how sites are
selected.  It is up to the application to implement either a
time-accurate rKMC method for event selection with a correct
null-event or a Metropolis method.
</P>
<P>For all three algorithms (KMC, rKMC, Metropolis) the rules for how
events are defined and are accepted or rejected are discussed in the
doc pages for the individual applications.
</P>
<P>Here is a table of the different kinds of solvers and sweeping options
that can be used for on- and off-lattice applications in SPPARKS.
Serial and parallel refer to running on one or many processors.
Sector vs no-sector is what is set by the <A HREF = "sector.html">sector</A>
command.  The rKMC options are set by the <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command.
The Metropolis options are the same as for rKMC.

<P>Note that the choice of <I>color</I> can also be <I>color/strict</I> and that
masking can also be turned on for rKMC algorithms via the
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> command if the application supports it.
Off-lattice applications do not support the <I>color</I> option.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For general applications, none of the keyword/value pairs can be used
as part of the app_style command.
</P>
<P>For on-lattice and off-lattice applications, the <I>lattice</I> keyword
must be specified.  The <I>procs</I>, <I>site</I>, and <I>input</I> keywords are
optional.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>lattice</I> keyword determines the initial set of sites used for on-
and off-lattice applications.  In the on-lattice case, these sites are
static.  In the off-lattice case, they represent particles which may
move or disappear as the model evolves.  In the on-lattice case, the
choice of lattice also defines the neighbors of each site.  In the
off-lattice case, the neighbor information is ignored.  For example,
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising 12345 lattice sq/4n 100 100 
</PRE>
<P>means use a 2d square lattice of size 100x100 with 4 neighbors per
lattice site.  A variety of lattice types and neighbor stencils can be
given as options with the <I>lattice</I> keyword as described above.
</P>
<P>The <I>line</I> lattice type is a 1d regular lattice.  The <I>sq</I> and <I>sc</I>
lattice types are 2d square and 3d cubic lattices.  The total number
of lattice sites is one per unit cell, i.e. the product of <I>nx</I>, <I>ny</I>,
and <I>nz</I>.  The <I>fcc</I>, <I>bcc</I>, and <I>diamond</I> lattice types are 3d and
generate multiple lattice sites per unit cell: 4 per fcc unit cell, 2
per bcc unit cell, and 8 per diamond unit cell.  The <I>fcc/octa/tetra</I>
lattice is more complex.  It is an fcc lattice with additional
interstitial sites at octahedral and tetrahedral locations, which can
be thought of as 3 inter-penetrating lattices.
</P>
<P>For on-lattice models, the connectivity of the various lattice types
is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>line/2d = 1d regular lattice with 2 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sq/4n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sq/8n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (1st and 2nd nearest neighbors)
<LI>tri = 2d triangular lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sc/6n = 3d cubic lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sc/26n = 3d cubic lattice with 26 neighbors per site (1st,2nd,3rd nearest neighbors)
<LI>fcc = 3d fcc lattice with 12 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>bcc = 3d fcc lattice with 8 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>diamond = 3d fcc lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>fcc/octa/tetra = 3d lattice with up to 26 neighbors per site, depending on the site 
</UL>
<P>The <I>random</I> lattice options generate a lattice of random points
within a 1d, 2d, or 3d box of specified size (0-xbox,0-ybox,0-zbox).
The <I>cutoff</I> criterion is used to assign lattice neighbors to each
site for on-lattice models.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> lattice option reads in a lattice and (optionally) neighbor
connectivity from the specified <I>filename</I>.  The format of this file
is as follows where the comments (#) are not included in the file, and
"vertex" is a lattice site, and an "edge" is a neighbor connection
from one site to another.  Typically neighbors should be geometrically
close, but that is not required.  Note that a single connection
between two sites is listed twice, once as edge IJ, and once as edge
JI.

<P>For on-lattice applications, all of this information is required to be
in the file.  For off-lattice applications, the "Edges" section is
ignored and can be omitted.  The "connectivity" count of max edges is
required, but is ignored, so it can be listed as 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For on- and off-lattice applications, by default SPPARKS will decide
how to partition the simulation domain across processors in order to
minimize communication of site information.  Typically this will
create a 2d grid of processors for 2d problems, and a 3d grid of
processors for 3d problems.  You can override the default and specify
your own grid of Px by Py by Pz processors using the <I>procs</I> keyword.
For 2d problems, Pz must be 1.  For 1d problems Py and Pz must be 1.
If <I>procs 0 0 0</I> is specified, then SPPARKS will decide the
partitioning.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For on- and off-lattice applications, by default each site stores a
single integer value.  By specifying <I>site</I>, multiple integer and or
double values can be stored on each site and accessed/updated by your
application.  For example, an integer flag could be stored for the
"type" of the site and one or more doubles could store the state of
the site.  If <I>site 0 0</I> is specified, then the default of a single
integer per site is used.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For on- and off-lattice applications, the values stored on each site
can be initialized explicitly via the <I>input</I> keyword.  This can be
useful for restarting a simulation from the dump file generated by a
previous simulation.  See the "dump2input.py" script in the tools
directory for a way to convert a dump file to the input format
described below.
</P>
<P>Normally, if the <I>input</I> keyword is not used, the application will
initialize the sites in some random manner.
</P>
<P>The file specified with the <I>input</I> keyword should have the following
format.  As before, the comments (#) need not be included in the file.
</P>
<PRE>comment              # 1st line is skipped
Nsite nvalue         # Nsite = total # of sites, nvalue = values/site
                     # skipped line
1 value1 value2 ...
2 value1 value2 ...
...
Nsites value1 value2 ...   # Nsite lines 
</PRE>
<P>In the body of the file, there is one line per site.  These lines can
be in any order.  The first field on the line is the ID of the site,
which should be an integer from 1 to Nsite.  There should be "nvalue"
remaining fields on each line.  These values are assigned to that
site.  How many values there should be (nvalue) depends on the
application.  For those with a single integer value (Nint = Ndouble =
0, nvalue = 1), just list that value.  If the <I>site</I> keyword is used
(Nint and/or Ndouble != 0, nvalue = Nint+Ndouble), then list the
integer value(s) first, followed by the double value(s).
</P>

<P>There is no default for the <I>lattice</I> keyword.  It must be specified
for on- and off-lattice applications.  The default values for the
