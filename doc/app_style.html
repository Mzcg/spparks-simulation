</P>
<P>This command defines what application SPPARKS will run.
</P>
<P>define an application for SPPARKS to run
see commands for individual styles
</P>
<P>styles derived from AppLattice2d and AppLattice3d allow for
  the following options:
</P>
<P>options = (random) or (read <filename>)
</P>
<P>styles derived from the generic AppLattice allow for the 
  the following options:
</P>
<P>options = lattice or site
  lattice style args ...
    2d styles = sq/4n or sq/8n or tri
      lattice sq/4n a nx ny
      lattice sq/8n a nx ny
      lattice tri a nx ny
        a = lattice constant
	nx,ny = number of square or rectangular unit cells
    3d styles = sc/6n or sc/26n or fcc or bcc or diamond
      lattice sc/6n a nx ny nz
      lattice sc/26n a nx ny nz
      lattice fcc a nx ny nz
      lattice bcc a nx ny nz
      lattice diamond a nx ny nz
        a = lattice constant
	nx,ny,nz = number of square or rectangular unit cells
    random styles = random/2d or random/3d
      lattice random/2d N xbox ybox cutoff
      lattice random/3d N xbox ybox zbox cutoff
        N = # of lattice points
	xbox,ybox,zbox = extent of simulation domain
	cutoff = distance cutoff for connectivity between sites
    file style = file
      lattice file filename
        filename = file that contains lattice points and connectivity
	see format below
  site N M
    N = # of int quantites to store on each site
    M = # of double quantites to store on each site
    if both are 0, then a single int is stored in the variable "lattice"
    otherwise multiple arrays of ints and doubles are stored
</P>
<P>file format for the lattice file style:

  Ndim dimension       # Ndim = 2 or 3
  N vertices           # N = global vertices
