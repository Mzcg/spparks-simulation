<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines what model or application SPPARKS will run.
There are 2 basic kinds of applications: on-lattice and off-lattice.
For lattice-based simulations, there are 3 variants: those on a 2d
square lattice, on a 3d cubic lattice, and on a general lattice which
can be either 2d or 3d and of various kinds.  The reason for these
variants is that we are still experimenting with the best way to write
lattice appications in SPPARKS.  Eventually, we will probably support
only the general lattice option, so it is probably best to develop new
on-lattice MC applications for that style.
</P>
<P>Here is the list of on-lattice applications SPPARKS currently
includes.  Each of these applications has 2d, 3d, and general lattice
variants as illustrated above.  See the doc for each application for
details:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">diffusion</A> = vacancy exchange diffusion model
<LI><A HREF = "app_ising.html">ising</A> = Ising model
<LI><A HREF = "app_membrane.html">membrane</A> = membrane model of lipid,water,protein
<LI><A HREF = "app_potts.html">potts</A> = multi-state Potts model for grain growth 
</UL>
<P>Here is the list of off-lattice applications SPPARKS currently
includes:
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "app_chemistry.html">chemistry</A> = biochemical reaction networks
<LI><A HREF = "app_test_group.html">test/group</A> = artificial chemical networks that test <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> 
</UL>
<P>Depending on the application, the model it represents can be evolved
in one or two ways.
</P>
<P>The first method is to use a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) solver,
specified by the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> command.  If the
application supports parallel KMC evolution, then the "sweep_style kmc
yes" command is also used in conjunction with a KMC solver.  In this
scenario the application defines a list of "events" and associated
probabilities, the solver chooses the next event, and the application
updates the system accordingly.  For off-lattice applications the
definition of an "event" is arbitrary.  For on-lattice application
zero or more possible events are typically defined for each lattice
site.
</P>
<P>The second method, which is supported by many of the on-lattice
applications, is to sweep over the lattice and use a rejection-based
Metropolis algorithm to accept or reject events occuring on each site.
The style of sweeping is specified by the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> command.  No
<A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> command is specified in this scenario.
</P>
<P>For both methods (KMC and Metropolis) the rules for how events are
chosen and accepted or rejected are discussed in the doc pages for the
individual applications.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For 2d and 3d lattice applications, the kind of lattice used and its
size are determined by the application style and its arguments.  E.g.
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising/2d/4n 100 100 12345 
</PRE>
<P>means a 2d square lattice of size 100x100 with 4 neighbors per
lattice.  The only lattice types supported in this mode are 2d square
and 3d cubic, though the neighbor stencil can be of various kinds
(e.g. 4 or 8 neighbors in 2d).  See the doc pages for individual
applications for details.
</P>
<P>For general lattice applications, the kind of lattice used and its
size are independent of the application and must be specified by the
<I>lattice</I> keyword and its values.  E.g.
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising 12345 lattice sq/4n 100 100 
</PRE>
<P>means exactly the same thing as the 2d lattice example above, namely a
2d square lattice of size 100x100 with 4 neighbors per lattice site.
A variety of lattice types and neighbor stencils are given as options
with the <I>lattice</I> keyword as described above.
</P>
<P>The <I>sq</I> and <I>sc</I> lattice types are 2d square and 3d cubic lattices
The total number of lattice sites is one per unit cell, i.e. the
product of <I>nx</I>, <I>ny</I>, and <I>nz</I>.  The <I>fcc</I>, <I>bcc</I>, and <I>diamond</I>
lattice types are 3d and generate multiple lattice sites per unit
cell: 4 per fcc unit cell, 2 per bcc unit cell, and 8 per diamond unit
cell.
</P>
<P>The connectivity of these lattice types is as follows:
</P>
<UL><LI>sq/4n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sq/8n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (1st and 2nd nearest neighbors)
<LI>tri = 2d triangular lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sc/6n = 3d cubic lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>sc/26n = 3d cubic lattice with 26 neighbors per site (1st,2nd,3rd nearest neighbors)
<LI>fcc = 3d fcc lattice with 12 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>bcc = 3d fcc lattice with 8 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>diamond = 3d fcc lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors) 
</UL>
<P>The <I>random/2d</I> and <I>random/3d</I> lattice options generate a lattice of
random points within a 2d or 3d box of specified size
(0-xbox,0-ybox,0-zbox), generated by a random number generator using
the specified <I>seed</I>.  The <I>cutoff</I> criterion is used to assign
lattice neighbors to each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>file</I> lattice option reads in a lattice and neighbor connectivity
from the specified <I>filename</I>.  The format of this file is as follows
where the comments (#) are not included in the file, and "vertex" is a
lattice site, and an "edge" is a neighbor connection from one site to
another.  Typically neighbors should be geometrically close, but that
is not required.  Note that a connection between two sites is listed
twice, once as edge IJ, and once as edge JI.

<P>For 2d and 3d lattice applications, there is always one integer
stored per lattice site, which your application can access and update.
</P>
<P>For general lattice applications, the <I>site</I> keyword can be used.  By
default each lattice site stores a single integer value.  By
specifying <I>site</I>, multiple integer and or double values can be stored
on each site and accessed/updated by your application.  For example,
an integer flag could be stored for the type of lattice site and one
or more doubles could store the state of the site.  If <I>site 0 0</I> is
specified, then the default of a single integer per site is used.
