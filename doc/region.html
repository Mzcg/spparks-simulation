<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command defines a geometric region of space.  Various other
commands use regions.  For example, the region can be filled with
sites via the <A HREF = "create_sites.html">create_sites</A> command.
</P>
<P>The distance units used to define the region are setup by the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command which must be used before any regions
are defined.  The lattice command defines a lattice spacing and
regions are defined in terms of this length scale.  For example, if
the lattice spacing is 3.0 and the region sphere radius is 2.5, then
the size of the sphere is 2.5*3.0 = 7.5.
</P>
<P>The lo/hi values for the <I>block</I> or <I>cylinder</I> styles can be specified
as EDGE or INF.  EDGE means they extend all the way to the global
simulation box boundary.  Note that this is the current box boundary;
if the box changes size during a simulation, the region does not.  INF
means a large negative or positive number (1.0e20), so it should
encompass the simulation box even if it changes size.  If a region is
defined before the simulation box has been created (via
<A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> or <A HREF = "read_sites.html">read_sites</A>
commands), then an EDGE or INF parameter cannot be used.
</P>
<P>For style <I>cylinder</I>, the c1,c2 params are coordinates in the 2 other
dimensions besides the cylinder axis dimension.  For dim = x, c1/c2 =
y/z; for dim = y, c1/c2 = x/z; for dim = z, c1/c2 = x/y.  Thus the
third example above specifies a cylinder with its axis in the
y-direction located at x = 2.0 and z = 3.0, with a radius of 5.0, and
extending in the y-direction from -5.0 to the upper box boundary.
</P>
<P>The <I>union</I> style creates a region consisting of the volume of all the
listed regions combined.  The <I>intersect</I> style creates a region
consisting of the volume that is common to all the listed regions.
</P>
<P>The <I>side</I> keyword determines whether the region is considered to be
inside or outside of the specified geometry.  Using this keyword in
conjunction with <I>union</I> and <I>intersect</I> regions, complex geometries
can be built up.  For example, if the interior of two spheres were
each defined as regions, and a <I>union</I> style with <I>side</I> = out was
constructed listing the region-IDs of the 2 spheres, the resulting
region would be all the volume in the simulation box that was outside
both of the spheres.
