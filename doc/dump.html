<H3>dump command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump delta filename keyword values field1 field2 ... 
</PRE>
<LI>delta = time increment between dumps (seconds)
filename = name of file to dump snapshots to
keyword =  logfreq 

<PRE>  <I>logfreq</I> values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>field = <I>id</I> or <I>lattice</I> or <I>x</I> or <I>y</I> or <I>z</I> or <I>energy</I> or <I>propensity</I> or <I>iN</I> or <I>dN</I> 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump 0.25 tmp.dump
dump 5.0 snap.ising id lattice energy
dump 1.0 snap.erbium logfreq 9 10.0 id i1 i2 x y z 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump snapshots of the state of the lattice to a file at intervals of delta
during a simulation.  The quantities printed are obtained from
the application.  Only lattice-based applications support dumps since
what is output is one line per lattice site.
</P>
<P>Using the <I>logfreq</I> keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be <I>N</I>
outputs per interval where the size of each interval scales up by
<I>factor</I> each time.  <I>Delta</I> is the time between outputs in the first
(smallest) interval.
</P>
<P>For example, this command
</P>
<PRE>dump 0.1 snap.erbium logfreq 7 10.0 id i1 i2 x y z 
</PRE>
<P>will dump snapshots at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.7, 1, 2, ...., 7, 10, 20, .... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>dump 0.1 snap.erbium logfreq 1 2.0 id i1 i2 x y z 
</PRE>
<P>will dump snapshots at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, ... 
</PRE>
<P>By default (if no fields are listed), the output values for each
site are the "id lattice x y z".  This is in the format of a <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS
dump file</A> which can thus be read-in by the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py
toolkit</A>, converted to other formats, or used for visualization.
</P>
<P>If fieldss are listed then only those quantities will be printed for
each lattice site.
</P>
<P>The <I>id</I> is a unique integer ID for each site.
</P>
<P>The <I>lattice</I> value is typically the integer state of the lattice,
e.g. the spin value, assuming the application uses the lattice array.
Some applications store multiple values per lattice site; see the
<I>site</I> option of the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.  You can
specify these values be dumped as <I>iN</I> or <I>dN</I>, where i = integer, d =
double, and N = which value to print (1,2,3,...).
</P>
<P>The <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>z</I> values are the coordinates assigned to the lattice
site.  The <I>energy</I> value is what is computed by the energy() function
in the application.  Likewise for the <I>propensity</I> value which can be
thought of as the relative probablity for that site to perform a KMC
event.  Note that if you are doing Metropolis MC and not kinetic MC,
no propensity is defined.
</P>
<P>When running in parallel, the order of sites as printed to the dump
file will be in chunks by processor, not ordered by ID.  The order
will be the same in every snapshot.
</P>




<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of the lattice-based
applications.  See the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for further
details.
