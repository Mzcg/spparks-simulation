diag_style erbium command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style erbium keyword value keyword value ... :pre

erbium = style name of this diagnostic :ulb,l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to a diagnostic command and which must appear before these keywords :l
keyword = {list} :l
  {list} values = {er} or {h} or {he} or {vac} or {events} or {sN} or {dN} or {tN}
    {er},{h},{he},{vac} = counts of how many lattice sites of this type currently exist
    {events} = total # of events currently defined for all sites
    {sN},{dN},{tN} = cummulative # of events for this reaction that have occurred :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

diag_style erbium stats yes list h he vac events s1 d1 t2 :pre

[Description:]

The erbium diagnostic prints out statistics about the system being
modeled by "app_style erbium"_app_erbium.html.  The values will be
printed as part of "stats"_stats.html output.  You must use the "stats
yes" keyword/value which is discussed with the
"diag_style"_diag_style.html command in order to enable this output.

Following the {list} keyword you can list one or more of the listed
values, in any order.  The {sN}, {dN}, and {tN} values refer to events
defined by the "event"_event.html command.  The letter "s" means
reactions involving a single site, "d" means double reactions
involving 2 sites, and "t" means triple reactions involving 3 sites.
The N refers to which reaction (from 1 to the number of that type of
reaction).  I.e. "t2" means the 2nd 3-site reaction defined in your
input script.  Note that the statistical values printed for {sN},
{dN}, and {tN} are cummulative counts from the beginning of the
simulation run.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
erbium"_app_erbium.html application.

[Related commands:]

"diag_style"_diag_style.html, "stats"_stats.html

[Default:] none
