<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These applications evolve a 2-state Ising model, where each lattice
site has a spin of 1 or 2.  Sites flip their spin as the model
evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and delta_ij
is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0 otherwise.
</P>
<P>These Ising models can be run in one of several modes, either as a
general lattice application or as a 2d square lattice application or
as a 3d square lattice application.  See the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand for further discussion.  When
running as a general lattice application, the lattice is specified by
the appended <I>lattice</I> keword with its associated values, as discussed
on the doc page for the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.  When run
as a 2d or 3d lattice application the style name also determines how
many neighbors per site are defined:
</P>
<UL><LI>2d/4n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>2d/8n = 2d square lattice with 8 neighbors per site (1st and 2nd nearest neighbors)
<LI>3d/6n = 3d cubic lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>3d/26n = 3d cubic lattice with 26 neighbors per site (1st,2nd,3rd nearest neighbors) 
</UL>
<P>All the Ising applications except those with "exchange" in the style
name perform Glauber dynamics, meaning they flip the spin on a single
site.  The applications with "exchange" in the style name perform
Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two neighboring sites are
swapped.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For the Glauber dynamics applications with solution by a KMC
algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its probability is
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial using the
Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T is the
temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For the Glauber dynamics applications with solution by a Metropolis
algorithm, the spin is set randomly to 1 or 2 and dE = Efinal -
Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R between 0 and
1.  The new state is accepted if R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)].
</P>
<P>For the Kawasaki dynamics applications with solution by a KMC
algorithm, the possible events a site can perform are swaps with any
neighbor site with a spin different than itself.  The probability of
each such event is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
and E is the sum of the energy for the site and its neighbor.
</P>
<P>For the Kawasaki dynamics applications with solution by a Metropolis
algorithm, the spin is flipped to its opposite state and dE = Efinal -
Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R between 0 and
1.  The flip is accepted if R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is
rejected.
