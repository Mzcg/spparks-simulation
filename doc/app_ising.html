<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application evolves a 2-state Ising model, where each lattice
site has a spin of 1 or 2.  Sites flip their spin as the model
evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and delta_ij
is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0 otherwise.
</P>
<P>This application performs Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See "app_style diffusion" for an Ising
model which performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, thus application can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection kinetic
Monte Carlo (rKMC) algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or
rejection method to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or <A HREF = "sweep_style.html">reject_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the spin is set randomly to 1 or 2
and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random
number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)].
