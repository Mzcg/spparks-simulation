<P>The deposition diagnostic calculates counts of the total cummulative
number of successful and failed deposition events since the simulation
began.  These values are printed as stats output via the
<A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A> command.
</P>
<P>A successful deposition event is one that resulted in an atom added to
the lattice.  A failed deposition event is one that was attempted but
no suitable site could be found and thus no atom was added.
