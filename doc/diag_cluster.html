<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The cluster diagnostic computes a clustering analysis on all lattice
sites in the system, identifying geometric groupings of identical spin
values, e.g. a grain in a grain growth model. The total number of
clusters is printed as stats output via the <A HREF = "stats.html">stats</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Clustering uses a connectivity definition provided by the application
(e.g. sites are adjacent and have same spin value) to identify the set
of connected clusters.
</P>
<P>The variants cluster, cluster2d, and cluster3d are used with
applications based on lattice, lattice2d, and lattice3d, respectively.
</P>
<P>The <I>filename</I> keyword allows a file to be specified which a full 
listing of cluster statistics is written to.
</P>
<P>The <I>dump</I> keyword causes the cluster ID for each site to be printed
out in snapshot format which can be used for visualization purposes.
The cluster IDs are arbitrary integers such that two sites have the
same ID if and only if they belong to the same cluster. The <I>standard</I>
setting generates LAMMPS-style. For <I>cluster2d</I> and <I>cluster3d</I> styles
only two values are printed for each site: site index and cluster
ID. For the <I>cluster</I> style, three additional values are printed: the
x, y, and z coordinate of the site (for 2d lattices, z=0).  These
files can be visualized with various tools in the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS
package</A> and the <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py package</A>.
</P>
<P>The <I>opendx</I> keyword generates a set of files that can be read by the
OpenDX script called aniso0.net to visualize the clusters in 3D. The
filenames are composed of the input filename, followed by a sequential
number, followed by '.dx'.  Because the OpenDX format assumes a
particular ordering of the sites, the <I>opendx</I> style can only be used
with square and simple cubic lattices.
</P>




<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Applications need to provide push_connected_neighbors() and
connected_ghosts() functions which are called by this diagnostic.  If
they are not defined, SPPARKS will print an error message.
</P>
<P>As described by the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command, on-lattice
applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d, or 3d.  For
this diagnostic you must use a style that matches the application's
lattice.  The <I>cluster</I> style is for general lattices, the <I>cluster2d</I>
and <I>cluster3d</I> styles are for 2d and 3d lattices.
