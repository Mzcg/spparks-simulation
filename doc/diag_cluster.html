<P>Cluster analysis is available for 3D, 2D, general lattice apps, if the
push_connected_neighbors() and connected_ghosts() functions have been
defined. If not, SPPARKS will exit with a helpful error
message. Clustering uses an application-defined site-site connectivity
(e.g. sites are adjacent and have same spin value) to identify the set
of connected clusters. It prints the number of sites in each cluster
to a file specified by the filename option.  The number of clusters is
used for stats output. If a dump_style option is given, then the
cluster id for each site is printed out. The cluster ids are arbitrary
integers such that two sites have the same id if and only if they
belong to the same cluster. The standard dump_style generates
LAMMPS-like output with two columns: site index and cluster id. The
opendx dump_style generates a file that can be read by the OpenDX
script called aniso0.net to visualize the clusters in 3D. OpenDX can
also be used to visualize 2D lattices.
