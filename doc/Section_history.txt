10. Future and history :h3

This section lists features we are planning to add to KMC, features
of previous versions of KMC, and features of other parallel
molecular dynamics codes I've distributed.

10.1 "Coming attractions"_#10_1

10.1 Coming attractions :h4,link(10_1)

These are new features we'd like to eventually add to KMC.  Some
are being worked on; some haven't been implemented because of lack of
time or interest; others are just a lot of work!

Monte Carlo bond-swapping for polymers (was in Fortran KMC)
torsional shear boundary conditions and temperature calculation
bond creation potentials
point dipole force fields
many-body and bond-order potentials for materials like C, Si, or silica
modified EAM (MEAM) potentials for metals
REAXX force field from Bill Goddard's group
Parinello-Rahman non-rectilinear simulation box :ul
