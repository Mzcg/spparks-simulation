diag_style energy command :h3
diag_style energy2d command :h3
diag_style energy3d command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style style keyword value keyword value ... :pre

style = {energy} or {energy2d} or {energy3d}
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to any diagnostic command :ul

[Examples:]

diag_style energy
diag_style energy2d
diag_style energy3d :pre

[Description:]

The energy diagnostic computes the total energy of all lattice sites
in the system. The energy is printed as stats output via the "stats"_stats.html
command.

[Restrictions:]

As described by the "app_style"_app_style.html command, on-lattice
applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d, or 3d.  For
this diagnostic you must use a style that matches the application's
lattice.  The {energy} style is for general lattices, the {energy2d}
and {energy3d} styles are for 2d and 3d lattices.

[Default:] none
