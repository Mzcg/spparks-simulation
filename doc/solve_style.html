<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>solve_style style args 
</PRE>
<P>style = <I>linear</I> or <I>tree</I> or <I>group</I>
<I>linear</I> args = seed

<I>tree</I> args = seed

<I>group</I> args = lo hi (ngroups) seed 
  lo,hi = range of propensities
  ngroups = # of groups to use (optional parameter)
  seed = random number seed (positive integer)

<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Choose a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) solver to use in your
<A HREF = "app_style.html">application</A>.  If no <A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweeper</A> is
used then a solver is required.  If a sweeper with the KMC option is
used, then a solver is also required.
</P>
<P>A KMC solver picks events for your application to perform from a list
of events and their associated probabilities.  It does this using the
standard <A HREF = "#Gillespie">Gillespie</A> or <A HREF = "#BKL">BKL</A> algorithm which also
computes a timestep for the chosen event to occur at.  The only
difference between the various solver styles are their speed and
scalability as a function of the number of events they choose from.
The linear solver may be suitable for simulations with few events; the
tree or group solver should be used for larger simulations.
</P>
<P>The <I>linear</I> style chooses an event by scanning the list of events in
a linear fashion.  Hence the cost to pick an event scales as O(N),
where N is the number of events to choose from.
</P>
<P>The <I>tree</I> style chooses an event by creating a binary tree of
probabilities and their sums, as in the <A HREF = "#Gibson">Gibson/Bruck</A>
implementation of the Gillespie algorithm.  It's cost to pick an
event scales as O(logN).
</P>
<P>The <I>group</I> style chooses an event using the composition and rejection
(CR) algorithm described originally in <A HREF = "#Devries">Devries</A> and
described concisely in <A HREF = "#Slepoy">Slepoy</A>.  It's cost to pick an event
scales as O(1) as it is a constant time algorithm.  It requires that
you bound the lo and hi probabilities for any event.  By default, if
no <I>ngroups</I> arg is listed or it is specified as 0, then the number of
groups between lo and hi, then the group boundaries cascade in powers
of 2 from lo to hi.  I.e. the first group is from lo to 2*lo, the
second group is from 2*lo to 4*lo, etc.  Note that for hi/lo = 1.0e6,
there would be about 20 groups.
