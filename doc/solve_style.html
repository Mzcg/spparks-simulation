<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Choose a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) solver to use in your
<A HREF = "app_style.html">application</A>.  If no <A HREF = "sweep.html">sweeper</A> is used then
a solver is required.
</P>
<P>A KMC solver picks events for your application to perform from a list
of events and their associated probabilities.  It does this using the
standard <A HREF = "#Gillespie">Gillespie</A> or <A HREF = "#BKL">BKL</A> algorithm which also
computes a timestep during which the chosen event occus.  The only
difference between the various solver styles is the algorithm they use
to select events which affects their speed and scalability as a
function of the number of events they choose from.  The <I>linear</I>
solver may be suitable for simulations with few events; the <I>tree</I> or
<I>group</I> solver should be used for larger simulations.
</P>
<P>The <I>linear</I> style chooses an event by scanning the list of events in
a linear fashion.  Hence the cost to pick an event scales as O(N),
where N is the number of events.
</P>
<P>The <I>tree</I> style chooses an event by creating a binary tree of
probabilities and their sums, as in the <A HREF = "#Gibson">Gibson/Bruck</A>
implementation of the Gillespie direct method algorithm.  Its cost to
pick an event scales as O(logN).
</P>
<P>The <I>group</I> style chooses an event using the composition and rejection
(CR) algorithm described originally in <A HREF = "#Devroye">Devroye</A> and
discussed in <A HREF = "#Slepoy">Slepoy</A>.  Its cost to pick an event scales as
O(1) as it is a constant time algorithm.  It requires that you bound
the <I>hi</I> and <I>lo</I> probabilities for any event that will be registered
with the solver.  Note that on-lattice applications typically register
the total probability of all a site's events with the KMC solver.  The
value of <I>lo</I> must be > 0.0 and <I>lo</I> cannot be >= <I>hi</I>.
</P>
<P>By default, the <I>group</I> style will create groups whose boundaries
cascade upward in powers of 2 from <I>lo</I> to <I>hi</I>.  I.e. the first group
is from lo to 2*lo, the second group is from 2*lo to 4*lo, etc.  Note
that for hi/lo = 1.0e6, there would thus be about 20 groups.
</P>
<P>If the <I>ngroup</I> keyword is used, then it specifies the number of
groups to use between <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> and they will be equal in extent.
E.g. for <I>ngroup</I> = 3, the first group is from lo to lo + (hi-lo)/3,
the second group is from lo + 2*(hi-lo)/3, and the third group is from
lo + 2*(hi-lo)/3 to hi.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> style deletes any KMC solver previously defined.  This may
be useful for transitioning from a KMC solver in one run to a
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweeping method</A> with a rejection-KMC solver in a
subsequent run.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>ngroup</I> keyword can only be used with style <I>group</I>.
