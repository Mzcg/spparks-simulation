<H3>app_style command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = application style name
<LI>args = args 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>solve_style linear seed
solve_style tree seed
solve_style alias seed
solve_style group lo hi seed
solve_style group lo hi ngroups seed
solve_style gppt seed
</P>
<P>seed = RN seed
lo,hi = range of propensities
ngroups = 0 (or not listed), use logarithmic scaling
ngroups > 1, use this number of groups
</P>
<P>update of sites owned by a processor via a KMC algorithm
  which chooses events and associated timesteps randomly
used when running a non lattice app (chemistry, surf, test)
  can only run on 1 processor
if used with a lattice app (ising, potts, membrane, migration)
  and no sweep style is set
    can only run on 1 processor
    entire domain is treated via KMC
if used with a lattice app and a sweep style is set
  if running on 1 processor, domain is partitioned into sectors
    KMC is run on each and periodic boundaries are updated after each event
  if running in parallel, each proc's sub-domain is partitioned into sectors
    KMC is run on each and boundaries are updated between sectors
    this is an approximate parallel KMC algorithm
</P>
<P>style linear chooses the next event in linear, cost = O(N)
  update of propensities is O(1)
style tree chooses the next event from a binary tree, cost = O(NlogN)
  update of propensities is also O(NlogN)
style alias does what?
style group does what?
style gppt does what?
