<H3>10. Future and history

<P>This section lists features we are planning to add to KMC, features
of previous versions of KMC, and features of other parallel
molecular dynamics codes I've distributed.

<H4><A NAME = "10_1"></A>10.1 Coming attractions

<P>These are new features we'd like to eventually add to KMC.  Some
are being worked on; some haven't been implemented because of lack of
time or interest; others are just a lot of work!
