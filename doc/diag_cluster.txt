diag_style cluster command :h3
diag_style cluster2d command :h3
diag_style cluster3d command :h3

app_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

diag_style style delta keyword value keyword value ... :pre

style = {cluster} or {cluster2d} or {cluster3d} :ulb,l
delta = time increment between evaluations of the diagnostic (seconds) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :l
keyword = {filename} or {dump} :l
  {filename} value = name
    name = name of file to write clustering results to
  {dump} value = style filename
    style = {standard} or {opendx}
    filename = file to write viz data to :pre
see the "diag_style"_diag_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended to any diagnostic command :l,ule

[Examples:]

diag_style cluster 0.5
diag_style cluster2d 0.5
diag_style cluster3d 0.5
diag_style cluster3d 1.0 filename cluster3d.a.0.1.dat dump opendx cluster3d.a.0.1.dump :pre

[Description:]

The cluster diagnostic computes a clustering analysis on all lattice
sites in the system, identifying geometric groupings of identical spin
values, e.g. a grain in a grain growth model.

Clustering uses an a connectivity definition provided by the
application (e.g. sites are adjacent and have same spin value) to
identify the set of connected clusters.

The {filename} keyword allows a file to be specified which statistical
output is written to.

The {dump} keyword then the cluster ID for each site is printed out in
snapshot format which can be used for visualization purposes.  The
cluster IDs are arbitrary integers such that two sites have the same
ID if and only if they belong to the same cluster.  The {standard}
setting generates LAMMPS-style output with two columns: site index and
cluster ID.  It can be visualized with various tools in the "LAMMPS
package"_lammps and the "Pizza.py package"_pizza.  The {opendx}
setting generates a file that can be read by the OpenDX script called
aniso0.net to visualize the clusters in 3D.  OpenDX can also be used
to visualize 2D lattices of site values.

[Restrictions:]

Applications need to provide push_connected_neighbors() and
connected_ghosts() functions which are called by this diagnostic.  If
they are not defined, SPPARKS will print an error message.

As described by the "app_style"_app_style.html command, on-lattice
applications use one of 3 styles of lattice: general, 2d, or 3d.  For
this diagnostic you must use a style that matches the application's
lattice.  The {cluster} style is for general lattices, the {cluster2d}
and {cluster3d} styles are for 2d and 3d lattices.
