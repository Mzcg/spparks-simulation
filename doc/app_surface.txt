[Examples:]

app_style surface xcos 51.1 0.0 0.0 40.0 &
                  zcos 100.0 5.0 0.0 40.0 &

                  lattice tri 2.42 20 20 :pre

[Description:]

This application sets up a y-surface and simulates the evolution of
the surface. The keyword xcos means that the surface is cosine-shape
in the x-direction.  The parameters yfoot, yheight, xmin, and xmax
represents respectively the bottom y coordinate, the height in y
direction, and the x-coordinates of the left and the right valleys of
the cosine function so that sites above the function is
un-occupied. The keyword zcos and its parameters have similar meanings
except that they are applied in the z-direction. The keyword yfix has
an argument ymax. Any species below is not allowed to move so that
only the top surface is simulated.

The energy of the system is expressed as a pairwise summation of
the bonding energy E_b = bondener:

E = 0.5 Sum_i Sum_{j, j!=i} E_b :pre

Users should supply the bonding energy in their input file. For example:

bondener value :pre

Note that the value should be negative in the definition here as
formation of bonds reduces the energy.

As explained on "this page"_app_style.html, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
"sweep_style"_sweep_style.html and "solve_style"_solve_style.html
commands.

For solution by a KMC algorithm, the possible events a occupied site i
can perform are (a) regular jumps where its occupant hops to a nearest
neighbor vacant site j, or (b) Schwoebel jumps where the occupant at i
jumps through a nearest vacant site j1 to a second nearest vacant site
k around an occupied nearest site j2. The probability for an event to
occur is proportational to the corresponding jump frequency
\Gamma. This in turn is determined by a energy barrier Q = ebarrier
for regular jumps and Q = eSchwoebel for Schwoebel jumps, the atom
vibration frequency \nu = vibrafreq, and the energy difference before
and after the jump, dE = Efinal - Einitial. For dE <= 0, \Gamma = \nu
exp(-Q/kT), and for dE > 0, \Gamma = \nu exp[-(Q+dE)/kT], where k is
Boltzmann constant and T is temperature (in unit K). The energy
difference can be conveniently calculated as dE = E_b * (N_j - N_i),
where N_j and N_i are total numbers if occupied nearest neighbor sites
at site j and i respectively. User should supply values of vibrafreq,
ebarrier, and eSchwoebel using the following commands in the input
file:

vibrafreq        value
ebarrier         value Nmin_to
eSchwoebel       value Nmax_from Nmin_to :pre

Here valus are the values for the corresponding parameters. For
ebarrier, Nmin_to is an integer number used to control the jump. When
the total number of nearest occupied neighbors at destination is less
than Nmin_to, the jump is not allowed. For eSchwoebel, Nmax_from and
Nmin_to are two integer numbers used to control the jump. When the
total number of nearest occupied neighbors at origin is larger than
Nmax_from or when the the total number of nearest occupied neighbors
at destination is less than Nmin_to, the jump is not allowed. Nmin_to
= 0 means that no constraints is imposed on the jumps, Nmin_to = 1
would disallow evaporation, Nmin_to = 3 (2 in 2D) would mean that atom
always jump to a stable cradle site, etc. Similarly, large Nmax_from
value (e.g., Nmax_from = 11) would mean that atoms that are not on the
surface cannot make Schewoebel jumps, etc. Future work will implement
energy barrier tables so that each of the jumps is associated with a
separate energy barrier.

For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is flipped to its
opposite state and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The flip is accepted if R <
min\[1,exp(-dE/kT)\], else it is rejected.
