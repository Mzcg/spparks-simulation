app_style thermal_spray command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style nspins  nparticles lattice_site_size spread_ratio unmelt_fraction spread_ratio_std_dev minimum_final_thickness :pre

style = {thermal_spray}
nspins = number of possible spins
nparticles = maximum number of particles to deposit
lattice_site_size = size of lattice sites in microns
spread_ratio = mean value of spreading ratio distribution between spherical particle diameter and spread splat diameter
unmelt_fraction = the fraction of incident particles that are deposited as unmelted hemispheres
spread_ratio_std_dev = standard deviation of spreading ratio distribution
minimum_final_thickness = the simulation will terminate once all parts of the coating are at least this thick (in lattice sites)

[Examples:]

app_style thermal_spray 1  1000 2 2.5 0.01 0.1 40 :pre

[Description:]


  
:line

[Restrictions:]

Domain cannot be decomposed into subregions in the z-direction. For parallel simulations, specify decomposition with the "processor"_processor.html command.

Only compatible with square cubic lattices.

[Default:]

As explained above the default for grad_z = 0.0.
