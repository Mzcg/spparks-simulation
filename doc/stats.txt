called on a timestep when the diagnostic was not called, the
information provided by the diagnostic may be old.

there is an option called logfreq that requires two arguments,
the number of repetitions and the boost factor:

This gives t = 0,0.01,0.02,...,0.07,1.0,2.0,....,7.0,10.0,20.0,....
stats       0.01 logfreq 7 10.0

This gives t = 0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,...
stats           0.01 logfreq 1 2.0
