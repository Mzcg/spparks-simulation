app_style diffusion/multiphase command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style diffusion/multiphase :pre

[Examples:]

app_style diffusion/multiphase
diffusion/multiphase pin 1           # after creating sites
diffusion/multiphase phase 2
diffusion/multiphase phase 3
diffusion/multiphase weight 0.5 pair 2 3 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application which is a multiphase extension to
the single phase "diffusion"_app_diffusion.html app.  This app can run
with an arbitrary number of phases, but is is limited to the energy
style {linear} option of the "diffusion"_app_diffusion.html app.

In general, diffusion can lead to phase separation when bond energies
(energy of a pair of neighboring sites) between like phases are lower
than bond energies between different phases.  The rate of phase
separation and the degree to which it occurs can be controlled by
setting the relative bond energies between different phases.

As illustrated in the example above, the
"diffusion/multiphase"_diffusion_multiphase.html command is used with this
application.  It defines phases, relative weights between pairs of phases, and
whether or not phases are pinned.  This app style does not have any
restrictions on the number of phases or the number of phases which are pinned;
in practice, if there are np pinned phases, then the total number of phases
will generally be at least np+2 -- otherwise there is no evolution.

To run this application, an initial phase distribution on the lattice
should be specified.  Each lattice site has an integer value
which stores its phase label.  If only relative volume fractions of
the phases is desired, the "set"_set.html command can be used to set
values.  If there is structure to the initial phase
distribution, this can be written to a SPPARKS input file and read via
the "read_sites"_read_sites.html command;  or, the "set
stitch"_set.html command can be used to read phase distribution from a
Stitch file formatted by the Stitch library included with SPPARKS.

The examples/diffusion_multiphase directory has several scripts which illusrate
use of this app; example scripts also demonstrate initializing phase
distributions.
