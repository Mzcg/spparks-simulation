app_style diffusion/multiphase command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style diffusion/multiphase :pre

The following commands defined by this app must be used to specify phases and
other optional app features.  All of the commands below must follow the 
'create_sites' command in the script.

"diffusion/multiphase phase"_diffmultiphase_phase.html: required command to specify a phase and its numeric label :l
"diffusion/multiphase pin"_diffmultiphase_pin.html: optional command to specify phase label which should be pinned :l
"diffusion/multiphase weight"_diffmultiphase_weight.html: optional command specifying weight for bond energy between specified phase pair :l

[Description:]

The phase separation app is a multiphase extension to the single phase
"diffusion"_app_diffusion.html app but limited to the energy style 'linear'; it
can run an arbitrary number of phases.  All phases must be declared using
either "diffusion/multiphase phase"_diffmultiphase_phase.html or "diffmultiphase
pin"_diffmultiphase_pin.html.  Only one phase can be declared as pinned; pinning a
phase is optional and prevents diffusion of that particular phase;  all
remaining phases must be declared using "diffusion/multiphase phase"_diffmultiphase_phase.html. 

A novelty of the app is the "diffusion/multiphase weight"_diffmultiphase_weight.html command
which is used to specify relative bonding energies between phases in the form
of pairwise weights.  In general, diffusion and phase separation occurs because
bond energies between like phases are lower than bond energies between
different phases; hence phase separation occurs because it is the preferred
lower energy configuration.  However, the rate of phase separation and the
degree to which it occurs over a particular simulation time is controlled by
the relative bond energies between different phases.  Some phases may more
easily bond with other phases; this is controlled using the optional "diffmultiphase
weight"_diffmultiphase_weight.html command to specify bond energies for each possible
phase pairing; by default all pairwise bond energies are set to 1.0.

To run this application, an initial phase distribution on the lattice must be
specified. Each lattice site has an integer value 'i1' which stores the phase
label; the phase label must be set to an appropriate value before the
app will run.  There are several ways to accomplish this initialization, some
more complex than others.  If it is only necessary to specify the volume
fraction of phases then it is most straight forward to use the
"set"_set.html command; this command can be used multiple times in sequence to
initialize needed volume fractions for different phases.  
On the other hand, if there is structure to the initial phase distribution
which must be computed externally, a straight forward approach is externally
create the phase distribution and write it directly to a stitch file which
can be imported into spparks using the 'stitch' style of the "set"_set.html command.
Examples below use the 'set' and 'set stitch' command to
demonstrate intialization.  It may also be possible to initialize the phase
distribution using the "read_sites"_read_sites.html and/or
"create_sites"_create_sites.html commands although that approach will be more
complex and slower as it may be necessary to also specify lattice coordinates and other
information.

# Example 1: see examples/diffusion_multiphase/in.pin_filler
#  * uses 'diffusion/multiphase pin' 
#  * uses 'diffusion/multiphase phase'
#  * uses 'set stitch' to initialize phase 1; remaining sites set to 0
#  * uses 'set i1 range' to randomly initialize remaining sites with phase 0
