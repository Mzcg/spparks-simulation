[Description:]

This application performs diffusive hops on a lattice whose sites are
partially occupied and partially unoccupied (vacancies).  It can be
used to model surface diffusion or bulk diffusion on 2d or 3d
lattices.  It is equivalent to a 2-state Ising model performing
Kawasaki dynamics where neighboring sites exchange their spins as the
model evolves.

The {estyle} setting determines how energy is used in computing the
probability of hop events, which is related to the Hamiltonian for the
system.

The Hamiltonian representing the energy of an occupied site I for the
{off} style is 0, which simply means energy is not used in determining
the hop probabilities.  Instead, see the "barrier"_barrier.html
command.

The Hamiltonian representing the energy of an occupied site I for the
{linear} and {linear/table} styles is as follows:

Hi = Sum_j delta_ij :pre

where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if site J is occupied and 1 if site J is vacant.  The Hi
for a vacant site is 0.  The only difference between the {linear} and
{linear/table} styles is how the energy is stored and calculated
internally.  The result from two simulations using these options
should be statistically the same, although not exactly the same, due
to differences in how events are chosen by random numbers.

The Hamiltonian representing the energy of an occupied site I for the
{nonlinear} style is as follows:

Hi = Eng(Sum_j delta_ij) :pre

where Sum_j is the sum over all its neighbor sites and delta_ij now 1
if site J is occupied and 0 otherwise.  Thus the summation computes
the coordination number of site I.  Note that this definition of delta
is the opposite of how it is defined for estyles {linear} and
{linear/table}.  The function Eng() is a tabulated function with
values specified via the "ecoord"_ecoord.html command.  This
effectively allows the energy to be a non-linear function of
coordination number.  As before the Hi for a vacant site is 0.

For all these {estyle} settings, the energy of the entire system is
the sum of Hi over all sites.

The {dstyle} setting determines what kind of diffusive hops are
modeled.  For {hop}, only simple nearest-neighbor hops occur where an
atom hops to a neighboring vacant site.  For {schwoebel}, Schwoebel
hops can also occur, which are defined in the following way.  An atom
I can hop to a 2nd neighbor vacant site K if there are two
intermediate 1st neighbor sites J1 and J2, where J1 is vacant and J2
is occupied, and J1 and J2 are neighbors of each other.  Additionaly
the initial site I can have no more the {Nmax} occupied neighbors (its
coordination number), and the destination site K can have no fewer
than {Nmin} neighbors.

The {gstyle} setting determines how the lattice geometry is
initialized.

For gstyle {none}, no explicit geometric initialization is performed,
rather it is assumed the {lattice file} option is used.  See the
"app_style"_app_style.html command for details.

For gstyle {surface}, a flat surface is initialized.  All sites below
{level} in 2d or 3d will be occupied.  Sites above the surface will be
vacant.

For gstyle {void}, the specified {fraction} of sites will be occupied,
the remained will be vacant.  Which sites are occupied versus vacant
is determined randomly.  Thus this sets up a bulk system with
(1-fraction) percent void fraction.

For gstyle {pore}, a thin film of {thickness} is setup with a
cylindrical pore of {diameter}, centered at (xc,yc,zc).  The axis of
the pore is along y for a 2d system and along z for a 3d system.

The "deposition"_deposition.html command can be used with this
application to add atoms to the system in competition with hop events.

The "barrier"_barrier.html command can be used with this application
to add an energy barrier to the model for nearest-neighbor hop and
Schwoebel hop events, as discussed below.

The "ecoord"_ecoord.html command can be used with the {nonlinear}
version of this application to set tabulated values for the
Hamiltonian Eng() function as described above.

Note that estyle {nonlinear} should give the same answer as {linear}
or {linear/table} if the tabulated function specified by the
"ecoord"_ecoord.html command is specified as E_0 = N, E_1 = N-1,
... E_N-1 = 1, E_N = 0, where N = the number of neighbors of each
lattice site, i.e. the maximum coordination number.  In this scenario,
the energy is effectively a linear function of coordination number.

This application is a general lattice application; see the
"app_style"_app_style.html commmand for further discussion.  The
lattice must be specified by the appended {lattice} keword with its
associated values, as discussed on the doc page for the
"app_style"_app_style.html command.

This application performs Kawasaki dynamics, in that the "spins" on
two neighboring sites are swapped, where spin can be thought of as a
flag representing occupied or vacant.  Equivalently, an atom hops from
an occupied site to a vacancy site.

As explained on "this page"_app_style.html, this application can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the "solve_style"_solve_style.html or
"sweep"_sweep.html commands.  The {linear} estyle supports both KMC
and rKMC options.  The other estyles only support KMC options.  If the
"deposition"_deposition.html command is used, then only KMC options
are supported.

For solution by a KMC algorithm, the possible events an occupied site
can perform are swaps with vacant neighbor sites.  The probability of
each such event depends on several variables: the {estyle} setting,
whether the "barrier"_barrier.html command is used, whether the hop is
downhill or uphill in energy, and whether the
"temperature"_temperature.html is 0.0 or finite.  The following table
gives the hop probability for each possible combination of these
variables.

Energy : Barrier : Direction : Temperature : Probability
no  :	   no  :	N/A  :	   either :     1
no  :	   yes :	N/A  :	   0.0	  :     0
no  :	   yes :	N/A  :	   finite :     exp(-Q/kT)
yes :	   no  :	down :	   either :     1
yes :	   no  :	up   :	   0.0	  :     0
yes :	   no  :	up   :	   finite :     exp(-dE/kT)
yes :	   yes :	down :	   0.0	  :     0
yes :	   yes :	down :	   finite :     exp(-Q/kT)
yes :	   yes :	up   :	   0.0	  :     0
yes :	   yes :	up   :	   finite :     exp((-dE-Q)/kT) :tb(s=:,ea=c)

If {estyle} is set to {off}, then energy is "no" in the table.  Any
other {estyle} setting is energy = "yes".  Barrier is "no" in the
table if the "barrier" command is not used, else it is "yes" in the
table.  The direction of energy change (downhill versus uphill) is
only relevant if energy is "yes", else it is N/A.  The "either" entry
for temperature means 0.0 or finite.

The value dE = Efinal - Einitial refers to the energy change in the
system due to the hop.  For estyle {linear} and {linear/table} this
can be computed from just the sites I,J.  For estyle {nonlinear} the
energy of the neighbors of both sites I,J must also be computed.

For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the hop event is performed or
not if the probability in the table is 1 or 0.  For intermediate
values, a uniform random number R between 0 and 1 is generated and the
hop event is accepted if R < probability in the table.
