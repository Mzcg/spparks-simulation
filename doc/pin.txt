pin command :h3

[Syntax:]

inclusion fraction :pre

fraction = fraction of sites (0 to 1) to convert to pinned sites :ul

[Examples:]

pin 0.1 :pre

[Description:]

This command converts sites on a lattice to pinned sites by setting
their spin value to Q+1, where Q is defined by a Potts model.  This
command can only be used by the "app_style
potts/pin"_app_potts_pin.html application.

Pinned sites are chosen randomly until the desired fraction of
changed sites is achieved.  The selection is done in a way
that should be independent of the number of processors used to
run a particular simulation.

[Restrictions:] none

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
potts/pin"_app_potts_pin.html applications.
