<H3>dump_modify command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump_modify dump-ID keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>dump-ID = ID of dump to modify 

<LI>one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>delay</I> or <I>delta</I> or <I>flush</I> or <I>logfreq</I> or <I>thresh</I> 

<PRE>  <I>delay</I> value = tdelay
    tdelay = delay dump until at least this time (seconds)
  <I>delta</I> arg = dt
    dt = time increment between dumps (seconds)
  <I>flush</I> arg = <I>yes</I> or <I>no</I>
  <I>logfreq</I> values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval
  <I>thresh</I> args = attribute operation value
    attribute = same fields (id,lattice,x,etc) used by <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command
    operation = "<" or "<=" or ">" or ">=" or "==" or "!="
    value = numeric value to compare to
    these 3 args can be replaced by the word "none" to turn off thresholding

<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>dump_modify 1 delay 30.0
dump_modify 1 logfreq 7 10.0 delay 100.0 flush yes
dump_modify mine thresh energy > 0.0 thresh id <= 1000 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump snapshots of the state of the lattice to a file at intervals of delta
during a simulation.  The quantities printed are obtained from
the application.  Only lattice-based applications support dumps since
what is output is one line per lattice site.
</P>
<P>The <I>delay</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<P>The <I>delta</I> keyword will suppress output until <I>tdelay</I> time has
elapsed.
</P>
<P>The <I>flush</I> option determines whether a flush operation in invoked
after a dump snapshot is written to the dump file.  A flush insures
the output in that file is current (no buffering by the OS), even if
SPPARKS halts before the simulation completes.
</P>
<P>The <I>logfreq</I> keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be <I>N</I>
outputs per interval where the size of each interval is initially
<I>delta</I> and then scales up by <I>factor</I> each time.
</P>
<P>For example, this command
</P>
<PRE>dump_modify 1 logfreq 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>will dump snapshots at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.7, 1, 2, ...., 7, 10, 20, .... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>dump_modify mine logfreq 1 2.0 
</PRE>
<P>will dump snapshots at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, ... 
</PRE>
<P>If <I>N</I> is specified as 0, then this will turn off logarithmic output,
and revert to regular output every <I>delta</I> seconds.
</P>
<P>The <I>thresh</I> keyword allows sub-selection of lattice sites to output.
Multiple thresholds can be specified.  Specifying "none" turns off all
threshold criteria.  If thresholds are specified, only sites whose
attributes meet all the threshold criteria are written to the dump
file.  The possible attributes that can be tested for are the same as
the fields that can be specified in the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command.
Note that different attributes can be output by the dump command than
are used as threshold criteria by the dump_modify command.  E.g. you
can output the coordinates and propensity of sites whose energy is
above some threshold.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used as part of the lattice-based
applications.  See the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for further
details.

<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>The option defaults are delay = 0.0, delta = whatever was used in the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command, flush = yes, logfreq = off, and thresh =
none.
