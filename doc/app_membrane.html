<H3>app_style command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = application style name
<LI>args = args 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style membrane w01 w11 mu seed options ...
app_style membrane/2d nx ny w01 w11 mu seed
</P>
<P>w01 = sovent-protein interaction energy (typically 1.25)
w11 = sovent-solvent interaction energy (typically 1.0)
mu = chemical potential to insert a solvent (typically -2.0)
</P>
<P>nx,ny = lattice size
seed = RN seed
options = options listed with the app_style command (e.g. lattice, site)
</P>
<P>run a 3-state membrane model
also need to define a "sweep" and/or "solve" style
</P>
<P>Model:
</P>
<P>site = one of 3 states (protein, lipid, solvent)
event = protein never changes, but other sites flip between lipid <-> solvent
</P>
<P>Hamiltonian:
</P>
<P>- mu Sum_i x_i - Sum_i Sum_j (w11 a_ij + w01 b_ij)
</P>
<P>where Sum_i is over all sites
      Sum_j is over neighbors of site i
      mu,w11,w01 = user inputs
      x_i = 1 if site is solvent, else 0
      a_ij = 1 if both i,j sites are solvent, else 0
      b_ij = 1 if one of i,j is solvent and other is protein, else 0
</P>
<P>This is a lattice gas GCMC model, isomorphic to a Ising model.  Basically
the mu term is a penalty for inserting solvent, to prevent the system
from going to all solvent (which the 2nd term would prefer).
</P>
<P>Extra commands supported by this app:
</P>
<P>inclusion xc yc r
  create a permanent circular protein inclusion at loc (xc,yc)
    of radius r
</P>
<P>run 0.5
  run for time (seconds)
temperature 2.0
  set temperature for Boltzmann factor (energy units of Hamiltonian)
dump lattice/coord 0.25
  dump snapshot every this often
  app_style membrane only allows for coord format
