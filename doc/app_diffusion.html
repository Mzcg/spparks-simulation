<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application performs diffusive hops on a lattice that is
partially occupied and partially unoccupied (vacant sites).  Thus it
can be used to model surface diffusion on a 2d lattice or bulk
diffusion on a 3d lattice.  It is equivalent to a 2-state Ising model
performing Kawasaki dynamics, where each lattice site has a spin of 1
or 2.  Neighboring sites exchange their spins as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0
otherwise.
</P>
<P>These is a general lattice application; see the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand for further discussion.  The
lattice must be specified by the appended <I>lattice</I> keword with its
associated values, as discussed on the doc page for the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>This application performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped or equivalently an atom hops from an
occupied site to a vacancy site.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, the possible events a site can
perform are swaps with any neighbor site with a spin different than
itself.  The probability of each such event is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)],
where dE = Efinal - Einitial and E is the sum of the energy for the
site and its neighbor.
</P>
<P>For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is flipped to its
opposite state and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The flip is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
