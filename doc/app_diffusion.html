<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application performs diffusive hops on a lattice whose sites are
partially occupied and partially unoccupied (vacancies).  Thus it can
be used to model surface diffusion on a 2d lattice or bulk diffusion
on a 3d lattice.  It is equivalent to a 2-state Ising model performing
Kawasaki dynamics.  Neighboring sites exchange their spins as the
model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I for the <I>diffusion</I>
and <I>diffusion/table</I> styles is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0
otherwise.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I for the
<I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> style is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = Eng(Sum_j delta_ij) 
</PRE>
<P>For the Kawasaki dynamics applications with solution by a KMC
algorithm, the possible events a site can perform are swaps with any
neighbor site with a spin different than itself.  The probability of
each such event is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
and E is the sum of the energy for the site and its neighbor.
</P>
<P>For the Kawasaki dynamics applications with solution by a Metropolis
algorithm, the spin is flipped to its opposite state and dE = Efinal -
Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform random number R between 0 and
1.  The flip is accepted if R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is
rejected.
</P>
<P>where H = 0 if a site is a vacancy.  If a site is occupied, Sum_j is
the sum over all its neighbor sites and delta_ij is 1 if site J is
occupied and 0 otherwise.  The function Eng() is a tabulated function
specified by the user via the <A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> command.  The inner
sum is effectively the coordination number of site I, and the energy
of site I is modeled as a function of the coordination number.
</P>
<P>The relationship between the 3 variants of app_style diffusion is as
follows.  Styles <I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I> are the same except
for how events and probabilities are stored and accessed internally.
Their results should be statistically the same, although not exactly
the same, due to differences in how events are chosen by random
numbers.
</P>
<P>The style <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> should give exactly the same answers
as <I>diffusion/table</I> if the tabulated function specified by the
<A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> command is set up so that E_0 = N, E_1 = N-1,
... E_N-1 = 1, E_N = 0.  N = the number of neighbors of each lattice
site, i.e. the maximum coordination number.  In this scenario, the
energy is a linear function of coordination number, which is
effectively the model used by the <I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I>
styles.  Note that while the dynamics of the 2 models will be
identical, the output energy of the system will be 2x larger in the
<I>diffusion/table</I> case versus the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> case.  This is
because the first Hamiltonian formulas above double-counts the energy
of a occupied site neighboring a vacancy site.
</P>
<P>Of course, if the specified <A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> values are not
specified as a linear function, then the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> style
will evolve differently.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These applications are general lattice application; see the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand for further discussion.  The
lattice must be specified by the appended <I>lattice</I> keword with its
associated values, as discussed on the doc page for the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>This application performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped.  Equivalently, an atom hops from an
occupied site to a vacancy site.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, the possible events an occupied site
can perform are swaps with vacant neighbor sites The probability of
each such event is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial.
For the <I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I> styles, E is the sum of the
energy for the site and its neighbor.  For the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I>
style, E is the sum of the energy for the site and its neighbor, and
also the energy of the neighbors of each of the 2 sites involved.
</P>
<P>For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is flipped to its
opposite state and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The flip is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.

<P>The following additional commands are defined by these applications.
The ecoord command is only defined by the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I>
application.
