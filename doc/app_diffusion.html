<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application performs diffusive hops on a lattice whose sites are
partially occupied and partially unoccupied (vacancies).  Thus it can
be used to model surface diffusion on a 2d lattice or bulk diffusion
on a 3d lattice.  It is equivalent to a 2-state Ising model performing
Kawasaki dynamics.  Neighboring sites exchange their spins as the
model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of an occupied site I for the
<I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I> styles is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if site J is occupied and 1 if site J is vacant.  The Hi
for a vacant site is 0.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of an occupied site I for the
<I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> style is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = Eng(Sum_j delta_ij) 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is the sum over all its neighbor sites and delta_ij now 1
if site J is occupied and 0 otherwise.  Thus the summation computes
the coordination number of site I.  Note that this definition of delta
is the opposite of how it is defined for styles <I>diffusion</I> and
<I>diffusion/table</I>.  The function Eng() is a tabulated function
specified by the user via the <A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> command, which
allows the energy to be a non-linear function of coordination number.
As before the Hi for a vacant site is 0.
</P>
<P>For all these applications, the energy of the entire system is the sum
of Hi over all sites.
</P>
<P>The relationship between the 3 variants of app_style diffusion is as
follows.  Styles <I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I> are the same except
for how events and probabilities are stored and accessed internally.
Their results should be statistically the same, although not exactly
the same, due to differences in how events are chosen by random
numbers.
</P>
<P>Note that the style <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> should give the same answers
(statistically) as <I>diffusion</I> or <I>diffusion/table</I> if the tabulated
function specified by the <A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> command is specified
with E_0 = N, E_1 = N-1, ... E_N-1 = 1, E_N = 0.  N = the number of
neighbors of each lattice site, i.e. the maximum coordination number.
In this scenario, the energy is effectively a linear function of
coordination number, which is the model used by the <I>diffusion</I> and
<I>diffusion/table</I> styles.
</P>
<P>Of course, if the specified <A HREF = "ecoord.html">ecoord</A> values are not
specified as a linear function, then the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I> style
will evolve differently.
</P>
<HR>

<P>These applications are general lattice application; see the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand for further discussion.  The
lattice must be specified by the appended <I>lattice</I> keword with its
associated values, as discussed on the doc page for the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>This application performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped.  Equivalently, an atom hops from an
occupied site to a vacancy site.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> commands.  The <I>diffusion</I> style supports both KMC
and rKMC options.  The <I>diffusion/table</I> and <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I>
styles only support KMC options.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, the possible events an occupied site
can perform are swaps with vacant neighbor sites.  The probability of
each such event is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial.
For the <I>diffusion</I> and <I>diffusion/table</I> styles, E is the sum of the
energy for the site and its neighbor.  For the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I>
style, E is the sum of the energy for the site and its neighbor, and
also the energy of the neighbors of each of the 2 sites involved.
</P>
<P>For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is flipped to its
opposite state and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The flip is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
</P>

<P>The following additional commands are defined by these applications.
The ecoord command is only defined by the <I>diffusion/nonlinear</I>
application.
