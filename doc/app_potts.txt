app_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style args :pre

style = application style name
args = args :ul

[Examples:]

app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 :pre

[Description:]

app_style potts seed nspins options ...
app_style potts/variable seed nspins options ...

app_style potts/2d/4n nx ny nspins seed
app_style potts/2d/8n nx ny nspins seed
app_style potts/2d/24n nx ny nspins seed

app_style potts/3d/6n nx ny nz nspins seed
app_style potts/3d/26n nx ny nz nspins seed
app_style potts/3d/12n nx ny nz nspins seed

nx,ny,nz = lattice size
nspins = # of possible spins
seed = RN seed
options = options listed with the app_style command (e.g. lattice, site)

run a Potts model with different #'s of neighbors in stencil
style potts is a generic AppLattice that can be used with various lattices
style potts/variable is a generic AppLattice
  that can be used with various lattices and also defines one int spin per site
style potts/... is a specific app for a particular lattice style
  24n and 12n define special 2-hop stencils
also need to define a "sweep" and/or "solve" style

Model:

site = integer spin from 1 to Q
event = flip a spin to a neighboring site value

Hamiltonian:

- Sum_i Sum_j delta_ij

where Sum_i is over all sites
      Sum_j is over neighbors of site i
      delta_ij = 1 if spin_i = spin_j, else 0

Rate: Min[1,exp(-E/kT)], where E is the energy change due to the spin flip.

More general Potts model:

The energy is a function of the site spin, neighbor spins, and one or
more field values (spin, etc).

The neighborhood for exchanges may not be the same as
the neighborhood used to compute site energies.

A mobility prefactor M(t) may be put in front of the rate factor.

Extra commands supported by these apps:

run 0.5
  run for time (seconds)
temperature 2.0
  set temperature for Boltzmann factor (energy units of Hamiltonian)
dump lattice/coord 0.25
  dump snapshot every this often
  either in lattice format or LAMMPS atom format (coord)
