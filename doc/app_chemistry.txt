app_style chemistry command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style chemistry :pre

chemistry = application style name :ul

[Examples:]

app_style chemistry :pre

[Description:]

This Monte Carlo application evolves a set of coupled chemical
reactions stochastically, producing a time trace of species
concentrations.  Individual molecules are assumed to interact in a
well-mixed fashion within a reaction volume.  The interaction rules
are those of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) of
"Gillespie"_#Gillespie.  A prototypical example is to use this model
to simulate the execution of a protein signaling network in a
biological cell.

You must also define a "solve_style"_solve_style.html to use this
application.

The following additional commands are defined by this application:x

"add_reaction"_add_reaction.html : define a chemical reaction
"add_species"_add_species.html : define a chemical species
"count"_count.html : specify molecular count of a species
"volume"_volume.html : specify volume of the chemical reactor :tb(s=:)

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
