<H3>app_style command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = application style name
<LI>args = args 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>app_style potts seed nspins options ...
app_style potts/variable seed nspins options ...
</P>
<P>app_style potts/2d/4n nx ny nspins seed
app_style potts/2d/8n nx ny nspins seed
app_style potts/2d/24n nx ny nspins seed
</P>
<P>app_style potts/3d/6n nx ny nz nspins seed
app_style potts/3d/26n nx ny nz nspins seed
app_style potts/3d/12n nx ny nz nspins seed
</P>
<P>nx,ny,nz = lattice size
nspins = # of possible spins
seed = RN seed
options = options listed with the app_style command (e.g. lattice, site)
</P>
<P>run a Potts model with different #'s of neighbors in stencil
style potts is a generic AppLattice that can be used with various lattices
style potts/variable is a generic AppLattice
  that can be used with various lattices and also defines one int spin per site
style potts/... is a specific app for a particular lattice style
  24n and 12n define special 2-hop stencils
also need to define a "sweep" and/or "solve" style
</P>
<P>Model:
</P>
<P>site = integer spin from 1 to Q
event = flip a spin to a neighboring site value
</P>
<P>Hamiltonian:
</P>
<P>- Sum_i Sum_j delta_ij
</P>
<P>where Sum_i is over all sites
      Sum_j is over neighbors of site i
      delta_ij = 1 if spin_i = spin_j, else 0
</P>
<P>Rate: Min<B>1,exp(-E/kT)</B>, where E is the energy change due to the spin flip.
</P>
<P>More general Potts model:
</P>
<P>The energy is a function of the site spin, neighbor spins, and one or
more field values (spin, etc).
</P>
<P>The neighborhood for exchanges may not be the same as
the neighborhood used to compute site energies.
</P>
<P>A mobility prefactor M(t) may be put in front of the rate factor.
</P>
<P>Extra commands supported by these apps:
</P>
<P>run 0.5
  run for time (seconds)
temperature 2.0
  set temperature for Boltzmann factor (energy units of Hamiltonian)
dump lattice/coord 0.25
  dump snapshot every this often
  either in lattice format or LAMMPS atom format (coord)
