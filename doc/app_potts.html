<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These applications evolve a Q-state Ising model, where each lattice
site has a spin value from 1 to Q.  Sites flip their spin as the model
evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and delta_ij
is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0 otherwise.
</P>
<P>These Potts models can be run in one of several modes, either as a
general lattice application or as a 2d square lattice application or
as a 3d square lattice application.  See the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand for further discussion.  When
running as a general lattice application, the lattice is specified by
the appended <I>lattice</I> keword with its associated values, as discussed
on the doc page for the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.  When run
as a 2d or 3d lattice application the style name also determines how
many neighbors per site are defined:
</P>
<UL><LI>2d/4n = 2d square lattice with 4 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>2d/8n = 2d square lattice with 8 neighbors per site (1st and 2nd nearest neighbors)
<LI>2d/24n = 2d square lattice with 24 neighbors per site (5x5 stencil surrounding each site)
<LI>3d/6n = 3d cubic lattice with 6 neighbors per site (nearest neighbors)
<LI>3d/12n = 3d cubic lattice with 12 neighbors per site (2 neighbors in each of 6 directions)
<LI>3d/26n = 3d cubic lattice with 26 neighbors per site (1st,2nd,3rd nearest neighbors) 
</UL>
<P>All the Potts applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning they flip
the spin on a single site.  The <I>potts/variable</I> application is
identical to the <I>potts</I> application except that the <I>site</I> keyword
(described with the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command) can be used to
define multiple quantities per site, instead of just a single spin
value.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip to a spin
value of a neighbor site different than itself.  For example, let a
site have 12 neighbors and those 12 spins have 4 different values, one
of which is the same as the central site.  There will then be 3 events
defined for the central site.  The probability of each event is
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial using the
Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T is the
temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is set to a random
value between 1 and Q, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if
R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
