<H3>app_style potts command 
</H3>
<H3>app_style potts/variable command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style Q rejectstyle seed keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>potts</I> or <I>potts/variable</I>
<LI>Q = number of spin states
<LI>rejectstyle = <I>spin</I> or <I>neigh</I> or <I>neighonly</I>
<LI>seed = random number seed (positive integer)
<LI>see the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for additional keywords that can be appended to the <I>potts</I> and <I>potts/variable</I> styles 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style potts 20 spin 18874 lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50
app_style potts/variable 20 neigh 18874 lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50 site 1 1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These applications evolve a Q-state Ising model or Potts model, where
each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.  Sites flip their spin
as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and delta_ij
is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0 otherwise.
</P>
<P>These applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See "app_style diffusion" for an Ising
model which performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped.
</P>
<P>The <I>potts/variable</I> application is identical to the <I>potts</I>
application except that the <I>site</I> keyword (described with the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command) can be used to define multiple
quantities per site, instead of just a single spin value.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, this application can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a rejection method or
KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">reject_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a rejection KMC (rKMC) algorithm, the spin is set
randomly to 1 or 2 and dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if
R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)].
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Metropolis
rejection-based algorithm.  You must thus define a sweeping method
and/or KMC solver to be used with the application via the
<A HREF = "sweep_style.html">sweep_style</A> and <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A>
commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip to a spin
value of a neighbor site different than itself.  For example, let a
site have 12 neighbors and those 12 spins have 4 different values, one
of which is the same as the central site.  There will then be 3 events
defined for the central site.  The probability of each event is
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial using the
Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T is the
temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a Metropolis algorithm, the spin is set to a random
value between 1 and Q, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a
uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if
R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
