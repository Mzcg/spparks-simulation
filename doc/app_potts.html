<H3>app_style potts command 
</H3>
<H3>app_style potts/variable command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style style Q rejectstyle keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style = <I>potts</I> or <I>potts/variable</I>
<LI>Q = number of spin states
<LI>rejectstyle = <I>spin</I> or <I>neigh</I> or <I>neighonly</I>
<LI>see the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for additional keywords that can be appended to the <I>potts</I> and <I>potts/variable</I> styles 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style potts 20 spin lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50
app_style potts/variable 20 neigh lattice sq/4n 1.0 50 50 site 1 1 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These applications evolve a Q-state Ising model or Potts model, where
each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.  Sites flip their spin
as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>H = - Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and delta_ij
is 1 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 0 otherwise.
</P>
<P>These applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See "app_style diffusion" for an Ising
model which performs Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two
neighboring sites are swapped.
</P>
<P>The <I>potts/variable</I> application is identical to the <I>potts</I>
application except that the <I>site</I> keyword (described with the
<A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command) can be used to define multiple
quantities per site, instead of just a single spin value.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the <I>rejectstyle</I> keyword determines
what rejection-based algorithm is used by the application.  For the
<I>spin</I> style, a random spin from 1 to Q is chosen.  For the <I>neigh</I>
style, a spin is chosen randomly from the values held by neighbor
sites and a null-bin (meaning no event).  For example, imagine a site
has 12 neighbors and those 12 spins have 4 different values.  Each of
the 4 spin values will be chosen with 1/12 probability and the null
bin chosen with 8/12 probability.  For the <I>neighonly</I> style, the null
bin is discarded, so each of the 4 spin values will be chosen with 1/4
probability.  In all the cases, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated,
as is a uniform random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is
accepted if R < min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
