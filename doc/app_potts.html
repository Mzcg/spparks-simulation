<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These applications evolve a Q-state Ising model or Potts model, where
each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q.  Sites flip their spin
as the model evolves.
</P>
<P>The Hamiltonian representing the energy of site I is as follows:
</P>
<PRE>Hi = Sum_j delta_ij 
</PRE>
<P>where Sum_j is a sum over all the neighbor sites of site I and
delta_ij is 0 if the spin of sites I and J are the same and 1 if they
are different.  The energy of the entire system is the sum of Hi over
all sites.
</P>
<P>These applications perform Glauber dynamics, meaning the spin is
flipped on a single site.  See <A HREF = "app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> for an Ising model which performs
Kawasaki dynamics, meaning the spins on two neighboring sites are
swapped.
</P>
<P>The <I>potts/variable</I> application is identical to the <I>potts</I>
application except that the <I>site</I> keyword must be used to define the
per-site quantities stored on the lattice.  The <I>site</I> keyword is
described with the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>As explained on <A HREF = "app_style.html">this page</A>, these applications can be
evolved by either a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or rejection KMC (rKMC)
algorithm.  You must thus define a KMC solver or sweeping method to be
used with the application via the <A HREF = "solve_style.html">solve_style</A> or
<A HREF = "sweep.html">sweep</A> commands.
</P>
<P>For solution by a KMC algorithm, a site event is a spin flip and its
probability is min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], where dE = Efinal - Einitial
using the Hamiltonian defined above for the energy of the site, and T
is the temperature of the system defined by the
<A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command (which includes the Boltzmann
constant k implicitly).
</P>
<P>For solution by a rKMC algorithm, the various styles use different
rejection-based algorithms.  For the <I>potts</I> and <I>potts/variable</I>
styles, a random spin from 1 to Q is chosen.  For the <I>potts/neigh</I>
style, a spin is chosen randomly from the values held by neighbor
sites and a null-bin of a size which extends the possible events up to
the maximum number of neighbors.  For example, imagine a site has 12
neighbors and the 12 sites have 4 different spin values.  Then each of
the 4 neighbor spin values will be chosen with 1/12 probability and
the null bin will be chosen with 8/12 probability.  For the
<I>potts/neighonly</I> style, the null bin is discarded, so in this case
each of the 4 spin values will be chosen with 1/4 probability.  In all
the cases, dE = Efinal - Einitial is calculated, as is a uniform
random number R between 0 and 1.  The new state is accepted if R <
min[1,exp(-dE/kT)], else it is rejected.
</P>
<P>Need to discuss rules for wild flips for KMC and rKMC.
