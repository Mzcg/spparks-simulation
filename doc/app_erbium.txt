app_style erbium command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style erbium frac seed keyword values ... :pre

erbium = application style name
frac = fraction of tetrahedral sites that will initially be hydrogen
seed = random number seed (positive integer)
see the "app_style"_app_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended :ul

[Examples:]

app_style erbium 0.1 12345 lattice file tmp.lattice site 2 0 :pre

[Description:]

This application simulates a model on a 3-fold lattice which consists
of an fcc lattice with additional tetrahedral and octahedral
interstitial sites.  The 3-fold lattice should be created using the
erbium_lattice.py tool in the tools directory and read in by the
{lattice} keyword of the "app_style"_app_style.html commmand.

This application initializes sites on the lattice in the following
way.  All fcc sites are for Erbium atoms.  All octahedral sites are
initially vacant.  A fraction of the tetrahedral sites, as specified
by {frac}, are initialized as Hydrogen atoms; the remainder are
vacant.

The "event"_event.html command is used to define what kinds of
diffusive hops occur in the model.  These can include correlated hops
where a central site coordinates a change of atoms on two of its
neighbors.  Events that transmute a Hydrogen atom to a Helium are also
possible.
