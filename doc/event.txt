event command :h3

[Syntax:]

event N eng :pre

N = coordination number
eng = energy of site with this coordination number (energy units) :ul

[Examples:]

ecoord 8 5.6
ecoord 0 1.0e20 :pre

[Description:]

This command defines an event for the "app_style erbium" application.

sets the energy of an occupied site in a lattice as a
function of coordination number, where coordination = the number of
occupied neighbor sites.  Typically this command should be used Nmax+1
times with N varying from 0 to Nmax+1, when Nmax is the number of
neighbor sites for each lattice site.

The {eng} value should be in the energy units defined by the
application's Hamiltonian and should be consistent with the units used
in any "temperature"_temperature.html command.

[Restrictions:] none
