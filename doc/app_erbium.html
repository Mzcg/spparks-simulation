<H3>app_style erbium command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>app_style erbium frac seed keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>erbium = application style name
<LI>frac = fraction of tetrahedral sites that will initially be hydrogen
<LI>seed = random number seed (positive integer)
<LI>see the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> command for additional keywords that can be appended 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>app_style erbium 0.1 12345 lattice file tmp.lattice site 2 0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This application simulates a model on a 3-fold lattice which consists
of an fcc lattice with additional tetrahedral and octahedral
interstitial sites.  The 3-fold lattice should be created using the
erbium_lattice.py tool in the tools directory and read in by the
<I>lattice</I> keyword of the <A HREF = "app_style.html">app_style</A> commmand.
</P>
<P>This application initializes sites on the lattice in the following
way.  All fcc sites are for Erbium atoms.  All octahedral sites are
initially vacant.  A fraction of the tetrahedral sites, as specified
by <I>frac</I>, are initialized as Hydrogen atoms; the remainder are
vacant.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "event.html">event</A> command is used to define what kinds of
diffusive hops occur in the model.  These can include correlated hops
where a central site coordinates a change of atoms on two of its
neighbors.  Events that transmute a Hydrogen atom to a Helium are also
possible.
