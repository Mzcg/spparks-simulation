app_style pore command :h3
app_style pore/nonlinear command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style xc yc zc diameter thickness keyword values ... :pre

style = {pore} or {pore/nonlinear}
xc,yc,zc = coordinates of center point of pore
diameter = xy diameter of cylindrical pore aligned along z axis
thickness = z thickness of thin film which the pore spans
see the "app_style"_app_style.html command for additional keywords that can be appended :ul

[Examples:]

app_style pore 10 10 10 4 10 lattice fcc 1.0 20 20 20 :pre

[Description:]

This application is exactly the same as the "app_style
diffusion"_app_diffusion.html application, except for the way the
lattice of occupied/vacant sites is initialized.

A single cylindrical pore in a thin-film membrane is setup.  The pore
is aligned with the z-axis and the thin film is periodic in the x and
y dimensions.

The {pore} style is equivalent to the "app_style
diffusion/table"_app_diffusion.html style.  The {pore/nonlinear} style
is equivalent to the "app_style
diffusion/nonlinear"_app_diffusion.html style.

:line

The following additional commands are defined by these applications.
The ecoord command is only defined by the {pore/nonlinear}
application.

"dump"_dump.html : output of lattice snapshots
"ecoord"_ecoord.html : energy as a function of coordination
"stats"_stats.html : output of system info
"temperature"_temperature.html : set Monte Carlo temperature :tb(s=:)
