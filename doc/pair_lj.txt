pair_style lj command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style lj Ntypes cutoff :pre

lj = style name of this pair style
Ntypes = # of particle types
cutoff = global cutoff for pairwise interactions (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style lj 1 2.5
pair_style lj 3 3.0 :pre

[Description:]

The {lj/cut} styles compute the standard 12/6 Lennard-Jones potential,
given by

:c,image(Eqs/pair_lj.jpg)

Rc is the cutoff.

The following coefficients must be defined for each pair of particle
types via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command:

epsilon (energy units)
sigma (distance units)
cutoff1 (distance units)
cutoff2 (distance units) :ul

Note that sigma is defined in the LJ formula as the zero-crossing
distance for the potential, not as the energy minimum at 2^(1/6)
sigma.

The latter 2 coefficients are optional.  If not specified, the global
LJ and Coulombic cutoffs specified in the pair_style command are used.
If only one cutoff is specified, it is used as the cutoff for both LJ
and Coulombic interactions for this type pair.  If both coefficients
are specified, they are used as the LJ and Coulombic cutoffs for this
type pair.  You cannot specify 2 cutoffs for style {lj/cut}, since it
has no Coulombic terms.

For {lj/cut/coul/long} and {lj/cut/coul/long/tip4p} only the LJ cutoff
can be specified since a Coulombic cutoff cannot be specified for an
individual I,J type pair.  All type pairs use the same global
Coulombic cutoff specified in the pair_style command.

[Mixing info]:

For atom type pairs I,J and I != J, the epsilon and sigma coefficients
and cutoff distance for all of the lj/cut pair styles can be mixed.
The default mix value is {geometric}.  See the "pair_modify" command
for details.
