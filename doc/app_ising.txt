app_style command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style args :pre

style = application style name
args = args :ul

[Examples:]

app_style ising 100 100
app_style potts 1000 1000 4 :pre

[Description:]

app_style ising seed options ...
app_style ising/2d/4n nx ny seed
app_style ising/2d/8n nx ny seed
app_style ising/3d/6n nx ny nz seed
app_style ising/3d/26n nx ny nz seed

nx,ny,nz = lattice size
seed = RN seed
options = options listed with the app_style command (e.g. lattice, site)

run an Ising model with different #'s of neighbors in stencil
style ising is a generic AppLattice that can be used with various lattices
style ising/... is a specific app for a particular lattice style
also need to define a "sweep" and/or "solve" style

Model:

site = spin 0 or 1
event = spin flip between 0 <-> 1

Hamiltonian:

- Sum_i Sum_j delta_ij

where Sum_i is over all sites
      Sum_j is over neighbors of site i
      delta_ij = 1 if spin_i = spin_j, else 0

Extra commands supported by these apps:

run 0.5
  run for time (seconds)
temperature 2.0
  set temperature for Boltzmann factor (energy units of Hamiltonian)
dump lattice/coord 0.25
  dump snapshot every this often
  either in lattice format or LAMMPS atom format (coord)
  app_style ising only allows for coord format

[Restrictions:] none
