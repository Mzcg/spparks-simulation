<H3>stats command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats delta keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>delta = time increment between statistical output (seconds) 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>logfreq</I> 

<PRE>  <I>logfreq</I> values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1
stats 1.0 logfreq 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print statistics to the screen and log file every so many seconds
during a simulation.  The quantities printed are elapsed CPU time
followed by those provided
by the <A HREF = "app_style.html">application</A>, followed by those provided by any
<A HREF = "diag_style.html">diagnostics</A> you have defined.
</P>
<P>Typically the application reports only the number of events or sweeps
executed, followed by the simulation time, but other
application-specific quantities may also be reported.  Quantities such
as the total energy of the system can be included in the output by
creating diagnostics via the <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command.
</P>
<P>Using the <I>logfreq</I> keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be <I>N</I>
outputs per interval where the size of each interval scales up by
<I>factor</I> each time.  <I>Delta</I> is the time between outputs in the first
(smallest) interval.
</P>
<P>For example, this command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1 logfreq 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.7, 1, 2, ...., 7, 10, 20, .... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1 logfreq 1 2.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, ... 
</PRE>
