<H3>stats command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats delta keyword values ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>delta = time increment between statistical output (seconds) 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>log</I> 

<PRE>  <I>log</I> values = N factor
    N = number of repetitions per interval
    factor = scale factor between interval 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.1
stats 1.0 log 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print statistics to the screen and log file every so many seconds
during a simulation.  The quantities printed are obtained by calling
the stats() functions belongs to the application and each of the 
diagnostics. Typically the application reports only the number of events
or sweeps executed, followed by the simulation time, but other
application-specific quantities may also be reported. 
Standard quantities such as energy can be included in the statistical
output by creating diagnostics via the <A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Using the <I>log</I> keyword will produce statistical output at varying
intervals during the course of a simulation.  There will be <I>N</I>
outputs per interval where the size of each interval scales up by
<I>factor</I> each time.  <I>Delta</I> is the time between outputs in the first
(smallest) interval.
</P>
<P>For example, this command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.01 log 7 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.07, 1.0, 2.0, ...., 7.0, 10.0, 20.0, .... 
</PRE>
<P>This command
</P>
<PRE>stats 0.01 log 1 2.0 
</PRE>
<P>will produce output at these times:
</P>
<PRE>t = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, ... 
</PRE>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>If stats is called on a timestep when a diagnostic is not called, then
the information provided by the diagnostic may be old.
