<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print statistics to the screen and log file every so many seconds
during a simulation.  The quantities printed are obtained from the

</P>
<P> and from any diagnostics defined using the
<A HREF = "diag_style.html">diag_style</A> command.  
</P>
<P>were created using diag_style commands. Note that if stats is
called on a timestep when the diagnostic was not called, the
information provided by the diagnostic may be old.
</P>
<P>there is an option called logfreq that requires two arguments,
the number of repetitions and the boost factor:
</P>
<P>This gives t = 0,0.01,0.02,...,0.07,1.0,2.0,....,7.0,10.0,20.0,....
stats       0.01 logfreq 7 10.0
</P>
<P>This gives t = 0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,...
stats           0.01 logfreq 1 2.0
