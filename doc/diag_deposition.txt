deposition = style name of this diagnostic :ul

[Description:]

The deposition diagnostic calculates counts of the total cummulative
number of successful and failed deposition events since the simulation
began.  These values are printed as stats output via the
"stats"_stats.html command.

A successful deposition event is one that resulted in an atom added to
the lattice.  A failed deposition event is one that was attempted but
no suitable site could be found and thus no atom was added.

[Restrictions:]

This diagnostic can only be used with the "app_style
diffusion2"_app_diffusion2.html application.

[Related commands:]

"diag_style"_diag_style.html, "stats"_stats.html

[Default:] none
