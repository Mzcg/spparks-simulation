<H3>SPPARKS Papers 
</H3>
<P>We don't yet have a general paper that describes SPPARKS and its
applications and algorithms.  We'll post one here when it's available.
Until then, please cite the <A HREF = "../spparks.html">SPPARKS WWW page</A>, if you use SPPARKS
in a paper.
</P>
<P>This paper describes the most novel KMC or event-selection algorithm
in SPPARKS, a constant-time composition-rejection algorithm, whose
cost to select a single event is independent of the total number of
available events:

Biochemical Reaction Networks</B>, A. Slepoy, A. P. Thompson,
S. J. Plimpton, J Chem Phys, 128, 205101
(2008). (<A HREF = "../abstracts/jcp08.html">abstract</A>)

<P>If you send us information about a paper that uses SPPARKS results,
we'll be pleased to add info about it to this page.  Ditto for a
picture or movie for the <A HREF = "pictures.html">Pictures & Movies</A> page.
