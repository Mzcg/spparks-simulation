<P>This technical report is the best overall description of SPPARKS and
its applications and algorithms.  Please cite this report and the
<A HREF = "index.html">SPPARKS WWW page</A>, if you use SPPARKS in a paper:

<P>This paper is about a sintering application developed for SPPARKS by
Cristina Garcia Cardona.  Time-evolution pictures of the process the
model can simlulate can be found on <A HREF = "pictures.html">this page</A>.

<P>This paper describes the most novel KMC or event-selection algorithm
in SPPARKS, a constant-time composition-rejection algorithm, whose
cost to select a single event is independent of the total number of
available events:
