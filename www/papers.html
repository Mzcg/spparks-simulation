<P>This technical report is the best overall description of SPPARKS and
its applications and algorithms.  Please cite this report and the

<P>This paper describes the most novel KMC or event-selection algorithm
in SPPARKS, a constant-time composition-rejection algorithm, whose
cost to select a single event is independent of the total number of
available events:
