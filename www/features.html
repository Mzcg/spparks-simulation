<H3>SPPARKS Features 
</H3>
<P>SPPARKS is a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) code that has algorithms for
both rejection-free KMC and null-event or rejection KMC (rKMC).  In a
generic sense its KMC and rKMC solvers catalog a list of "events",
each with an associated "probability", choose a single event to
perform, and advance time by the correct amount.  Events may be chosen
indivudually at random or a sweep of a geometric lattice can be
performed to select possible events in a more ordered fashion.
</P>
<P>Applications are implemented in SPPARKS which define events and their
probabilities and acceptance/rejection criteria.  They are coupled to
solvers or sweepers to perform KMC or rKMC simulations.  The KMC or
rKMC options for an application in SPPARKS can be written to define
rates based on energy differences between the initial and final state
of an event and a Metropolis-style accept/reject criterion based on
the Boltzmann factor SPPARKS will then perform a Metropolis-style
Monte Carlo simulation.

<H4>Code details 
</H4>
<P>SPPARKS is written in C++.  It runs on single-processor desktop or
laptop machines, but for some applications, can also be run in
parallel.  SPPARKS will run on any parallel machine that compiles C++
and supports the <A HREF = "http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">MPI</A> message-passing library.  This includes
distributed- or shared-memory machines.
</P>
<P>In parallel, a geometric partitioning of the simulation domain is
performed.  Sub-partitioning of processor domains into colors or
quadrants (2d) and octants (3d) is done to enable multiple events to
be performed on multiple processors simultaneously.  Communication of
boundary information is performed as needed.
</P>
<P>Parallelism can also be invoked to perform multiple runs on a
collection of processors, for statistical puposes.
</P>
<H4>Extensibility 
</H4>
<P>SPPARKS is designed to be easy to modify and extend.  For example, new
solvers and sweeping rules can be added, as can new applications.
Applications can define new commands which are read from the input
script.
</P>
<H4>Pre- and post-processing 
</H4>
<P>Our group has written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools which can be used to setup,
analyze, plot, and visualize data for SPPARKS simulations.  Pizza.py
is written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.

<H4>Open-source 
</H4>
<P>SPPARKS is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the <A HREF = "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</A>, which means you can use or
modify the code however you wish.  See <A HREF = "open_source.html">this page</A>
