<H4><A NAME = "abnormal"></A>Abnormal grain growth 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Liz Holm (eaholm at sandia.gov) at Sandia and Tod
Hoffman (now at ASU) and his advisor at Carnegie Mellon, to study the
mechanisms and statistics associated with abnormal grain growth.  In
normal grain growth, when the system is annealed, grain boundaries
will move and rearrange so as to increase the average grain size and
decrease the grain boundary area per unit volume.  Abnormal grain
growth can have many causes.  Here the effects of static particle
dispersions on the model are studied.  These should pin grain
boundaries in positions that maximize their contact with the
particles, so that grain growth cannot proceed.  However, occasionally
one grain breaks free and is able to grow at the expense of others,
leading to abnormal growth.
</P>
<P>The on-lattice SPPARKS application (<A HREF = "doc/app_potts_pin.html">app_style
potts/pin</A>) that runs this model implements a
Potts model of grain growth and also allows for inert pinning
particles.  The pinning particles can be inserted preferentially at
grain boundaries or throughtout the system.  Several hundred
independent runs were made on 300x300x300 lattices, each of at least a
million Monte Carlo steps (sweep over all lattice sites) at finite
simulation temperature, to acquire enough data for statistical
analysis.
</P>
<P>The images and movies show typical results for systems with 5 volume
percent pinning particles, inserted when the average grain radius was
10 sites.  In the normal case, the system becomes fully pinned.  In
the second case, abnormal growth eventually occurs.

<H4><A NAME = "erbium"></A>Erbium hydrides 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Corbett Battaile and Steve Plimpton at Sandia, to
model the mobility of gaseous species such as tritium and helium in
metal hydrides, like erbium.  Such hydrides are commonly used for
neutron generation in many applications in industry, medicine, and
national security, including petroleum exploration, explosives
detection, toxic waste analysis, and boron neutron capture therapy.
As tritium decays into helium, the helium gas clusters to form
bubbles, often found to be preferentially oriented along {111}
planes in the erbium lattice.
</P>
<P>The on-lattice SPPARKS application that runs this model uses an fcc
lattice with additional tetrahedral and octrahedral interstitial
sites.  Both the tritium and helium can diffuse through the lattice on
the interstitial sites.
</P>
<P>The image is a snapshot from a simulation on 1024 processors of a
500x500x500 unit-cell model (2 billion sites) which encodes the list
of 1-, 2-, and 3-site migration mechanisms for the two mobile species.
The helium (red) diffuses but is not yet aggregating due to a lack of
appropriate binding and barrier energies for the various event
configurations.  These values (inputs to SPPARKS) are currently being
calculated via density functional theory in the electronic structure
code <A HREF = "http://dft.sandia.gov/Quest">SeqQuest</A>.
