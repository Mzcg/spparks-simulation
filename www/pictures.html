<H4><A NAME = "abnormal"></A>Abnormal grain growth 
</H4>
<P>This is work by Liz Holm (eaholm at sandia.gov) at Sandia and Tod
Hoffman (now at ASU) and his advisor at Carnegie Mellon, to study the
mechanisms and statistics associated with abnormal grain growth.  In
normal grain growth, when the system is annealed, grain boundaries
will move and rearrange so as to increase the average grain size and
decrease the grain boundary area per unit volume.  Abnormal grain
growth can have many causes.  Here the effects of static particle
dispersions on the model are studied.  These should pin grain
boundaries in positions that maximize their contact with the
particles, so that grain growth cannot proceed.  However, occasionally
one grain breaks free and is able to grow at the expense of others,
leading to abnormal growth.
</P>
<P>The SPPARKS application (<A HREF = "doc/app_potts_pin.html">app_style potts/pin</A>)
that runs this mode implements a Potts model of grain growth and also
allows for inert pinning particles.  The pinning particles can be
inserted preferentially at grain boundaries or throughtout the system.
Several hundred independent runs were made on 300x300x300 lattices,
each of at least a million Monte Carlo steps (sweep over all lattice
sites) at finite simulation temperature, to acquire enough data for
statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>The images and movies show typical results for systems with 5 volume
percent pinning particles, inserted when the average grain radius was
10 sites.  In the normal case, the system becomes fully pinned.  In
the second case, abnormal growth eventually occurs.
