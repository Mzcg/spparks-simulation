<H3>Latest Features and Bug Fixes in SPPARKS 
</H3>
<P>This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for
the SPPARKS simulator.
</P>
<P>To stay up-to-date with the current SPPARKS, you can download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "download.html">download page</A> at any time,
which will include all the features/fixes listed below, and re-build
SPPARKS from scratch.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "version"></A>What version of SPPARKS do you have? 
</H4>
<P>A SPPARKS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  SPPARKS is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPPARKS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPPARKS.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPPARKS directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPPARKS WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPPARKS. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they
describe the version you have.

<P><B>15 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a glitch in the color table map for the <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump
image</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.15Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Jul 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>With considerable help from graphics whiz Nathan Fabian (Sandia), we
added a <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image</A> command with accompanying
options settable via the <A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.
</P>
<P>This enables you to write out a series of high-quality, ray-traced JPG
or PPM images of the collection of sites from lattice-based
applications.  Of course, this does not replace the need for a
full-featured, interactive post-processing visulization capability,
but it does provide a simple, easy way to quickly see how your
simulation is working, since there are numerous tools that can display
individual image files or animate a series of them.  It is also
convenient for very large models, as a replacement for large dump
snapshots.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "doc/dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page includes a couple sample
images you can view.
</P>
<P>As part of this command, the previous <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command now
requires a "style" argument, which can be either "text" or "image".
The previous dump command is now the "text" style.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Jul 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Jul 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed some problems with the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">group-style
solver</A>.  This includes one accuracy bug with the
way changed propensities were assigned to new groups, and some
bookkeeping changes for how zero-valued propensities were handled.
The specified <I>lo</I> and <I>hi</I> bounds can now be exact matches to event
propensities of your model.  A warning message is printed if generated
propensities violate the specified bounds.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Jul11">list of changed files</A> from the 5
Jul 2010 version.

<P><B>27 May 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with <A HREF = "doc/deposition.html">deposition</A> in the <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> application, that would prevent
deposition if the site at the origin ever became unoccupied.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.27May11">list of changed files</A> from the 30

</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.30Mar11">list of changed files</A> from the 21
Mar 2011 version.

<HR>

<P><B>21 Mar 2011</B>
</P>
<P>Enabled the region option on the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
command, so that sites can be created within a geometric region.
</P>
<P>Also converted some counters to 64-bit integers to avoid overflow.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.21Mar11">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Sept 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>16 Sept 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Added an <A HREF = "doc/app_potts_strain.html">app_style potts/strain</A>
application to model grain growth in the presence of a strain value at
each lattice site.  If SPPARKS is used as a library, then the strain
values can be updated dynamically by another application, such as
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</A>, via a driver code.  The LAMMPS distribution includes
an example coupling program that does this, in its "couple" directory.

parallel or with multiple sectors.

<A HREF = "doc/app_erbium.html">app_style erbium</A>, <A HREF = "doc/diag_erbium.html">diag_style
erbium</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/event.html">event</A>, to enable
on-lattice modeling of reaction/diffusion events for hydrogen and
helium in a fcc erbium lattice.  A further description of the model is
given on the <A HREF = "pictures.html">Pictures & Movie</A> page.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.21Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 20
Jan 2010 version.

<HR>

<P><B>20 Jan 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
command when building a lattice with an application
that stores 2 or more integers or doubles per site.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.20Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Jan 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>19 Jan 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Greg Wagner (Sandia) identified two bugs with the <A HREF = "doc/set.html">set
region</A> and <A HREF = "doc/create_sites">create_sites</A> commands, the
latter when using a region whose lower left corner was not at the
origin.  This upgrade fixes the problems.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Dec 2009</B>
</P>

</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>17 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with using <A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep color</A> with
<A HREF = "doc/sector.html">sectoring</A> in parallel.  The problem was that the
inter-sector communication was not complete.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.17Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.

<P><B>13 Nov 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Allow a "none" option with the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">solve_style</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep</A> commands so that KMC and rejection-KMC solvers
can be turned off in between successive runs.
