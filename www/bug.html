<H3>New Features and Bug Fixes in SPPARKS 
</H3>
<P>This page lists new features and bug fixes in the SPPARKS simulator
since the current version was released.
</P>
<P>To add these features/fixes to your version of SPPARKS, download the
current tarball from the <A HREF = "../download.html">download page</A>, which
includes all the new features/fixes listed below, and rebuild the
code.
</P>
<P>The current version of SPPARKS is 13 April 2009.

<P><B>19 Aug 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/diag_propensity.html">diag_style propensity</A> command to
enable total system propensity for KMC simulations to be output with
<A HREF = "doc/stats.html">statistics</A>.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Aug09">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Aug 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Aug 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added Schwoebel hops to <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion2.html">app_style diffusion2</A>
which are effectively 2nd nearest neighbor hops.  This also affected
the syntax of the <A HREF = "doc/barrier.html">barrier</A> and the output of the
<A HREF = "doc/diag_diffusion.html">diag_style diffusion</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Aug09">list of changed files</A> from the 23
Jul 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>23 Jul 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Also needed to update the examples input scripts to reflect the
changed syntax in <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> commands due to the 22Jul09 patch.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.23Jul09">list of changed files</A> from the 22
Jul 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>22 Jul 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Made some enhancements to the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command.  There are
now also <A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>,
<A HREF = "doc/dump_one.html">dump_one</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/undump.html">undump</A> commands.
All of them now take a dump ID, so that you can use multiple dump
files during a simulation if desired.
</P>
<P>Additional features include changing output times via the
<A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command, sub-selecting sites to output
via the <A HREF = "doc/dump_modify.html">dump_modify thresh</A> command, allowing
for one file per snapshot and/or one file per processor via wildcards
in the <A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command filename, and allowing for
output of binary or gzipped dump files.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.22Jul09">list of changed files</A> from the 20
Jul 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>20 Jul 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion2.html">app_style diffusion2</A> application
which will eventually replace all of the existing <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> and <A HREF = "doc/app_pore.html">app_style
pore</A> variants, once we've done some more testing.
</P>
<P>As part of the new, more general diffusion application, new commands
for defining energy <A HREF = "doc/barrier.html">barrier</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/deposition.html">deposition</A> event parameters were also added.
</P>
<P>A new lattice option for the on-lattice <A HREF = "doc/app_style.html">application
styles</A> was added.  It is <I>fcc/octa/tetra</I> and
defines an FCC lattice with additional interstitial octahedral and
tetrahedral sites.  It's useful for a new application we're developing
and will release at some point.
</P>
<P>This patch also includes a new option to run with the <A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep
color</A> and <A HREF = "doc/sector.html">sector yes</A> settings
together which was not previously allowed.  We think this will be
useful for some rejection KMC applications to enable faster sweeping
in parallel due to less communication, while still preserving the
independence of site updating that coloring provides.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.20Jul09">list of changed files</A> from the 7
Jul 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>7 Jul 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Added a <A HREF = "doc/dump_one.html">dump_one</A> command to force a shapshot of
the lattice to be written to the file specified by the
<A HREF = "doc/dump.html">dump</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.7Jul09">list of changed files</A> from the 26
Jun 2009 version.

<P><B>26 Jun 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Aidan Thompson (Sandia) fixed a bug in the recent <A HREF = "doc/diag_cluster.html">diag_style
cluster</A> upgrade.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.26Jun09">list of changed files</A> from the 24
Jun 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>24 Jun 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Enhanced the <A HREF = "doc/pin.html">pin</A> command for use by the <A HREF = "doc/app_potts_pin.html">app_style
potts/pin</A> command.  Also enhanced the grain
identification performed by the <A HREF = "doc/diag_cluster.html">diag_style
cluster</A> command to not include pinned sites.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.24Jun09">list of changed files</A> from the 12
May 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>12 May 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a dumb bug with the rejection method (rKMC) applied to
<A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style diffusion</A>.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.12May09">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<P>Thanks to Greg Wagner (Sandia) for identifying the problem.
</P>

<P><B>14 Apr 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Removed an application from the distribution that is still
a work-in-progress.  Wasn't meant to be released yet.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Apr09">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Apr 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>13 April 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Initial public release of SPPARKS.  17,341 lines of code in src dir.
This version supercedes earlier distributed beta versions.
