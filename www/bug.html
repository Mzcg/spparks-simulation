</P>
<P>Bug fixes in the way lattices of sites with unit cells of non-unit size
are generated.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.23Mar10">list of changed files</A> from the 4
Mar 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>4 Mar 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Changed the way solvers and random number generators are preserved
from run to run, so that consecutive runs should give identical
answers as one long continuous run.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.4Mar10">list of changed files</A> from the 2
Mar 2010 version.

<P>Corbett Battaile (Sandia) found a typo bug with the <A HREF = "doc/set.html">set x</A>
command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.2Mar10">list of changed files</A> from the 17

<P><B>17 Feb 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Greg Wagner (Sandia) found a memory bug with the way event lists are
cleared between runs, that affected a few of the applications that
maintain these lists.  This update fixes it.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.17Feb10">list of changed files</A> from the 16
Feb 2010 version.

<P><B>16 Feb 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a one-line bug with the <A HREF = "doc/app_sos.html">app_style sos</A> command
that reset the bond energy to 1.0 even after the user set it.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.16Feb10">list of changed files</A> from the 21
Jan 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>21 Jan 2010</B>
</P>
<P>In collaboration with Corbett Battaile (Sandia), added commands for
<A HREF = "doc/app_erbium.html">app_style erbium</A>, <A HREF = "doc/diag_erbium.html">diag_style
erbium</A>, and <A HREF = "doc/event.html">event</A>, to enable
on-lattice modeling of reaction/diffusion events for hydrogen and
helium in a fcc erbium lattice.  A further description of the model is
given on the <A HREF = "pictures.html">Pictures & Movie</A> page.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.21Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 20
Jan 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>20 Jan 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with the <A HREF = "doc/create_sites.html">create_sites</A>
command when building a lattice with an application
that stores 2 or more integers or doubles per site.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.20Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 19
Jan 2010 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>19 Jan 2010</B>
</P>
<P>Greg Wagner (Sandia) identified two bugs with the <A HREF = "doc/set.html">set
region</A> and <A HREF = "doc/create_sites">create_sites</A> commands, the
latter when using a region whose lower left corner was not at the
origin.  This upgrade fixes the problems.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.19Jan10">list of changed files</A> from the 18
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>18 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Greg Wagner (Sandia) added a solid-on-solid (SOS) model via a new
<A HREF = "doc/app_sos.html">app_style sos</A> command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.18Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 17
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>17 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug with using <A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep color</A> with
<A HREF = "doc/sector.html">sectoring</A> in parallel.  The problem was that the
inter-sector communication was not complete.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.17Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style
diffusion</A> command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 10
Dec 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>10 Dec 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed a memory bug in the <A HREF = "doc/app_diffusion.html">app_style diffusion</A>
command.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.10Dec09">list of changed files</A> from the 14
Nov 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>14 Nov 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Fixed an additional issue with the 13Nov09 patch.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.14Nov09">list of changed files</A> from the 13
Nov 2009 version.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>13 Nov 2009</B>
</P>
<P>Allow a "none" option with the <A HREF = "doc/solve_style.html">solve_style</A> and
<A HREF = "doc/sweep.html">sweep</A> commands so that KMC and rejection-KMC solvers
can be turned off in between successive runs.
</P>
<P>This is the <A HREF = "patches/files.13Nov09">list of changed files</A> from the 12
Nov 2009 version.
