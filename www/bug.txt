Latest Features and Bug Fixes in SPPARKS :h3

This page is a continuous listing of new features and bug fixes for
the SPPARKS simulator.

To stay up-to-date with the current SPPARKS, you can download the
current tarball from the "download page"_download.html at any time,
which will include all the features/fixes listed below, and re-build
SPPARKS from scratch.

What version of SPPARKS do you have? :h4,link(version)

A SPPARKS "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Sept
2010.  SPPARKS is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or
add a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of SPPARKS contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  The version date is printed to the
screen and logfile every time you run SPPARKS.  It is also in the file
src/version.h and in the SPPARKS directory name created when you
unpack a tarball.

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages on the SPPARKS WWW site, they
always describe the most current version of SPPARKS. :ulb,l

If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages included in your tarball, they

Made some upgrades to the dump image command to make it more
compatible with other versions of the code base for this class.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Dec11 from the 27
Oct 2011 version.

:line

[27 Oct 2011]

Made the length of the output string for statistics to be an
easily-changed setting in the src/output.cpp.  The default length is
now 4096 characters, which ought to be long enough for most
simulations.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27Oct11 from the 24
Oct 2011 version.

:line

[24 Oct 2011]

Fixed a bug in the new "boundary"_doc/boundary.html command which had
to do with hou neighbor sites were identified for on-lattice
applications when using lattices with multi-site basis sets.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Oct11 from the 23
Sep 2011 version.

Thanks to Antonio Gomez for finding and fixing the issue.

:line

[23 Sep 2011]

Added a "boundary" option to the "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html
command.  This allows boundaries to be drawn between adjacent sites
if their specified values are different.  It is useful for
visualizing the boundaries between aggregated groups of sites
when the colors of sites in the adjacent groups are the same.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Sep11 from the 22
Sep 2011 version.

[22 Sep 2011]

There were still some glitches in the 20Sep11 patch
with respect to non-periodic systems.  Hopefully this
patch fixes the remaining issues.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.22Sep11 from the 20
Sep 2011 version.

:line

[20 Sep 2011]

Added a "boundary"_doc/boundary.html command to allow specification of
non-periodic boundaries in an on-lattice application.  This affects
the way sites are created and eliminates site neighbors across
non-periodic boundaries.  See the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
and "read_sites"_doc/read_sites.html commands for more details.  Using
"create_sites region"_doc/create_sites.html is now supported to only
create sites within a geometric region.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Sep11 from the 2
Sep 2011 version.

:line

[2 Sep 2011]

Fixed an indexing bug in the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command.

Updated the input scripts in the examples to reflect the new syntax
for the "dump"_doc/dump.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.2Sep11 from the 29
Jul 2011 version.

[29 Jul 2011]

Upgraded the dummy MPI library (used with make serial) to
be compatible with the 64-bit options now available in SPPARKS.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.29Jul11 from the 25
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[25 Jul 2011]

Added a sweep counter back to the output stats for sectored
KMC solves.  Somehow this got lost from an earlier version.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.25Jul11 from the 18
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[18 Jul 2011]

Enhanced SPPARKS to be able to run arbitraryily large models with more
than 2 billions sites, limited only by the physical memory on your
machine.  This requires use of 64-bit integers to store site IDs and
various system tallies, like the number of accepted and rejected
events.

The data types for this are now defined in the file src/spktype.h,
which by default is set to allow for large problems.  To reduce memory
usage or for machines or MPI implementations that do not support
64-bit integers, you can revert to 32-bit integers by editing that
file.  See "this section of the manual"_doc/Section_start.html for
more details.

There is still a limit of around 2 billions sites per processor, which
should not be a restriction since that would have a huge memory
footprint to store neibhbor lists.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Jul11 from the 16
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[16 Jul 2011]

More upgrades to the "dump_image"_doc/dump_image.html command,
including an option to generate a list of random colors via the
"dump_modify scolor"_doc/dump_modify.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Jul11 from the 15
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[15 Jul 2011]

Fixed a glitch in the color table map for the "dump
image"_doc/dump_image.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Jul11 from the 14
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[14 Jul 2011]

With considerable help from graphics whiz Nathan Fabian (Sandia), we
added a "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html command with accompanying
options settable via the "dump_modify"_doc/dump_modify.html command.

This enables you to write out a series of high-quality, ray-traced JPG
or PPM images of the collection of sites from lattice-based
applications.  Of course, this does not replace the need for a
full-featured, interactive post-processing visulization capability,
but it does provide a simple, easy way to quickly see how your
simulation is working, since there are numerous tools that can display
individual image files or animate a series of them.  It is also
convenient for very large models, as a replacement for large dump
snapshots.

The "dump image"_doc/dump_image.html doc page includes a couple sample
images you can view.

As part of this command, the previous "dump"_doc/dump.html command now
requires a "style" argument, which can be either "text" or "image".
The previous dump command is now the "text" style.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Jul11 from the 7
Jul 2011 version.

:line

[7 Jul 2011]

Fixed some problems with the "group-style
solver"_doc/solve_style.html.  This includes one accuracy bug with the
way changed propensities were assigned to new groups, and some
bookkeeping changes for how zero-valued propensities were handled.
The specified {lo} and {hi} bounds can now be exact matches to event
propensities of your model.  A warning message is printed if generated
propensities violate the specified bounds.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.7Jul11 from the 5
Jul 2011 version.

[5 Jul 2011]

Fix a logic error with communication when performing multiple
runs with changing sector rules.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Jul11 from the 24
Jun 2011 version.

:line

[24 Jun 2011]

Made some lo-level changes within the lattice app base class
to support a new phase field app we'll release later.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.24Jun11 from the 15
Jun 2011 version.

[15 Jun 2011]

Eric Homer (Sandia) added a "diag_style array"_doc/diag_array.html
command to print stats on various lattice site values.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.15Jun11 from the 30
May 2011 version.

:line

May 2011 version.

:line

[27 May 2011]

Fixed a bug with "deposition"_doc/deposition.html in the "app_style
diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html application, that would prevent
deposition if the site at the origin ever became unoccupied.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27May11 from the 30
Mar 2011 version.

:line

[30 Mar 2011]

Added some additional hooks in the AppLattice class that a user
application can use to add custom functionality.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.30Mar11 from the 21
Mar 2011 version.

:line

[21 Mar 2011]

Enabled the region option on the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command, so that sites can be created within a geometric region.

Also converted some counters to 64-bit integers to avoid overflow.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Mar11 from the 16
Sept 2010 version.

:line

[16 Sept 2010]

Added an "app_style potts/strain"_doc/app_potts_strain.html
application to model grain growth in the presence of a strain value at
each lattice site.  If SPPARKS is used as a library, then the strain
values can be updated dynamically by another application, such as
"LAMMPS"_lammps, via a driver code.  The LAMMPS distribution includes
an example coupling program that does this, in its "couple" directory.

:link(lammps,http://lammps.sandia.gov)

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Sep10 from the 26

lattices.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.6Aug10 from the 5
Jun 2010 version.

Fixed a small bug in the library interface routine spparks_energy()
which returns the energy from a current configuration.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.5Jun10 from the 30
Apr 2010 version.

Added error checks to prevent the "deposition"_doc/deposition.html
option in "app_style diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html when running in
parallel or with multiple sectors.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.29Apr10 from the 28

Fixed a bug with dumping per-site double values.  Also added
a new routine so that child-class applications can reset how
many integers and doubles are stored per site.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.27Apr10 from the 6
Apr 2010 version.

are generated.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.23Mar10 from the 4
Mar 2010 version.

:line

[4 Mar 2010]

Changed the way solvers and random number generators are preserved
from run to run, so that consecutive runs should give identical
answers as one long continuous run.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.4Mar10 from the 2
Mar 2010 version.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.16Feb10 from the 21
Jan 2010 version.

:line

[21 Jan 2010]

In collaboration with Corbett Battaile (Sandia), added commands for
"app_style erbium"_doc/app_erbium.html, "diag_style
erbium"_doc/diag_erbium.html, and "event"_doc/event.html, to enable
on-lattice modeling of reaction/diffusion events for hydrogen and
helium in a fcc erbium lattice.  A further description of the model is
given on the "Pictures & Movie"_pictures.html page.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Jan10 from the 20
Jan 2010 version.

Fixed a bug with the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command when building a lattice with an application
that stores 2 or more integers or doubles per site.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.20Jan10 from the 19
Jan 2010 version.

:line

[19 Jan 2010]

Greg Wagner (Sandia) identified two bugs with the "set
region"_doc/set.html and "create_sites"_doc/create_sites commands, the
latter when using a region whose lower left corner was not at the
origin.  This upgrade fixes the problems.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Jan10 from the 18
Dec 2009 version.

Fixed a bug with using "sweep color"_doc/sweep.html with
"sectoring"_doc/sector.html in parallel.  The problem was that the
inter-sector communication was not complete.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Dec09 from the 14
Dec 2009 version.

:line

[14 Dec 2009]

Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the "app_style
diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Dec09 from the 10
Dec 2009 version.

:line

[10 Dec 2009]

Fixed a memory bug in the "app_style diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html
