In collaboration with Corbett Battaile (Sandia), added commands for
"app_style erbium"_doc/app_erbium.html, "diag_style
erbium"_doc/diag_erbium.html, and "event"_doc/event.html, to enable
on-lattice modeling of reaction/diffusion events for hydrogen and
helium in a fcc erbium lattice.  A further description of the model is
given on the "Pictures & Movie"_pictures.html page.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.21Jan10 from the 20
Jan 2010 version.

Fixed a bug with the "create_sites"_doc/create_sites.html
command when building a lattice with an application
that stores 2 or more integers or doubles per site.

Jan 2010 version.

Greg Wagner (Sandia) identified two bugs with the "set
region"_doc/set.html and "create_sites"_doc/create_sites commands, the
latter when using a region whose lower left corner was not at the
origin.  This upgrade fixes the problems.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.19Jan10 from the 18
Dec 2009 version.

[18 Dec 2009]

Greg Wagner (Sandia) added a solid-on-solid (SOS) model via a new
"app_style sos"_doc/app_sos.html command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.18Dec09 from the 17
Dec 2009 version.

[17 Dec 2009]

Fixed a bug with using "sweep color"_doc/sweep.html with
"sectoring"_doc/sector.html in parallel.  The problem was that the
inter-sector communication was not complete.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.17Dec09 from the 14
Dec 2009 version.

[14 Dec 2009]

Fixed a bug in the Schwoebel hop logic in the "app_style
diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html command.  Needed to update
propensities one site further away in neighbor list of each site then
we were.  This is 3rd neighbors instead of 2nd neighbors for linear
energies.  And 4th neighbors instead of 3rd neighbors for non-linear
energies.  This should make only a small difference in propensities of
these far-away site, but is important to bookkeep correctly.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Dec09 from the 10
Dec 2009 version.

[10 Dec 2009]

Fixed a memory bug in the "app_style diffusion"_doc/app_diffusion.html
command.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.10Dec09 from the 14
Nov 2009 version.

[14 Nov 2009]

Fixed an additional issue with the 13Nov09 patch.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.14Nov09 from the 13
Nov 2009 version.

[13 Nov 2009]

Allow a "none" option with the "solve_style"_doc/solve_style.html and
"sweep"_doc/sweep.html commands so that KMC and rejection-KMC solvers
can be turned off in between successive runs.

This is the "list of changed files"_patches/files.13Nov09 from the 12
Nov 2009 version.

The PDF version of the manual was out-of-date in yesterday's
release.  This patch updates it.
