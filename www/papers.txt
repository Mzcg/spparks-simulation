SPPARKS Papers :h3

We don't yet have a general paper that describes SPPARKS and its
applications and algorithms.  We'll post one here when it's available.
Until then, please cite the "SPPARKS WWW page"_sws, if you use SPPARKS
in a paper.

This paper describes the most novel KMC or event-selection algorithm
in SPPARKS, a constant-time composition-rejection algorithm, whose
cost to select a single event is independent of the total number of
available events:

[A Constant-Time Kinetic Monte Carlo Algorithm for Simulation of Large
Biochemical Reaction Networks], A. Slepoy, A. P. Thompson,
S. J. Plimpton, J Chem Phys, 128, 205101
(2008). ("abstract"_../abstracts/jcp08.html)

If you send us information about a paper that uses SPPARKS results,
we'll be pleased to add info about it to this page.  Ditto for a
picture or movie for the "Pictures & Movies"_pictures.html page.
